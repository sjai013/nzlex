That's exactly right. I've had a fairly long political and semi-political career, and because I didn't expect gratitude, occasionally I got it, but I didn't expect it and I was surprised when I did get it.

Well I don't think there's any harm in expecting it.

Are you really wanting to know my view of the present situation?

Ooo I couldn't say that we can't afford, there are one or two things that I think we might legitimately cut back on, but the basic things in social welfare I'm still thoroughly in favour of and I think we can afford.

Ah, well.

Yes I know it's enormous, but the plain fact is that the government in its wisdom or otherwise, has decided on a universal superannuation. That's one of the things that people today criticise and say 'why are you giving it to people who don't need it and in many cases don't deserve it?â€™. Now the real question there in my view is the difference between age sixty, and, say a later age, be it sixty-five or even seventy. I think perhaps New Zealand made a mistake in making universal superannuation at age sixty. Being well over that age now, I can say I think perhaps it might have been wiser to start at a later age.

One of the troubles

No, no admittedly it wouldn't be known as a tax, but you'd still be paying, assuming the same amount would be paid out by the private insurance company as it's paid out by the state, it would require at least as much as the state requires, only the state taxes whereas the other individual sends you a bill every six months or yearly or whatever it may be.

I think they may not be as enthusiastic, because the it has at least dawned upon many of them that they have to pay for it. It was alright while the other fellow paid, but when everybody is expected to pay more or less towards this scheme, there's not the same enthusiasm for it, I admit.

Well I think they largely do that because there are benefits that are available to them, from, through the society that are not available to others. And consequently they are prepared to pay. Now admittedly, there is a very wide sphere of social service in the health field, but unfortunately the medical profession were not as cooperative as I personally would have liked when we introduced the scheme, and people today will not receive as much as, in the way of benefits as they might have received if there had been more cooperation.

Well, I know that the whole situation has changed, when today the very few doctors will visit the homes even when there is a real need. There are still some of the medical men who feel that their duty to visit the patient at home, although admittedly they are fewer and fewer as years go by.

I don't think so, I don't think it's a result of it. I think it's a recognition on the part of the profession that the twenty-four hour day, seven day service that people expected of a doctor was entirely unreasonable. It was. And some people were over-exacting in expecting the doctor to run after them and to attend them, when it was just as easy for them to go to the surgery.

There will always be a section of the community that feels that they need medical care when they don't. I think that applies today just as much as it did twenty or thirty years ago. But the fact remains, when people think that they need attention by a doctor, they're ill. They may not, may not be ill from the doctor's point of view, but they do require attention, even if it's only a placebo.

It was then. Not as bad as it is today

Well 1935 you had such terrific unemployment. It was, it was far worse than it is today. And the there was little done for the unemployed. They were left to their own resources, and in many cases their resources were very slender. One of the things that induced me to come into politics was just that, there was something radically wrong with society that allowed that state of affairs.

Oh undoubtedly. And it was not only worse, but there was far less done for the unemployed than is done today.

Well those are the, the, the wealth is produced by labour, by capital, by a combination of the two, and the, I'm sure there is enough wealth in New Zealand to ensure that the, the social services that we have been proud of in this country are continued. I don't say that the resources are indefinite, and that it doesn't matter what you add to what is already there, you can still pay for it, I think there must come a limit and I believe that already there are some things that we could cut back on that are not as necessary today as they might have been say thirty or forty years ago.

No, well anything that would give comfort to Mr Muldoon I would beg to be excused from.

What is called National Superannuation. There is perhaps room there for what is know as a 'cut', what is called a 'cut', simply by ensuring that those who don't need it are not paid it. Now I know there are different points of view on this business of whether you should pay some people whether they need it or not, and I know that a number of people, including the present government believe that it's good, that everybody should receive this amount, notwithstanding the fact that many of them don't deserve it, or need it. I believe that there is, there could be something done about reducing the burden on the rest of the community that this entails.

Well it depends on what your definition of 'afford' is. It's I know that there are some people who are burdened, if that's the right word, with a big family, and yet

Well I haven't heard that term used ironically, but the, the plain fact is that without some form of family benefit, there are some people in the community today who simply couldn't exist.

Ooo I don't regard it as plunder, I think that taxation is a legitimate form of extraction, that the state exercises from time to time for purposes that some people regard as extravagant, but which others would regard as needful.

Now that's a difficult one, 'on as we are now'. Do you mean that we keep it at the present level?

I don't see anything wrong with the philosophy, and I believe that there are still things that could be done by the state. But at the same time, I've already recognised that the, there is room for improvement in some respects, and that it might be a good idea to look more carefully at the largesse that is distributed in some quarters.

I don't blame them.

Well I don't like saying that it's so much better than anybody now. What I do say is that some of the, of the speakers that I served under were outstanding in my view as speakers. For example Mr Barnard, who was member for ?? was the first speaker that I worked under, he was very good. Sir Matthew was very good, Sir Ronald wasn't so bad, but he suffered from his eyesight, he couldn't read unless the type had been enlarged for him, and consequently he was very slow sometimes, in picking up. One of the problems that I see as far as speakers go is that it's so necessary to act quickly, to quell what could be a disorderly scene. And it's necessary for the speaker to be firm and particularly, even if he does seem to be abrupt, to nip in the bud, as it were, impending trouble.

There was a certain amount of it, I get the impression there's more of it today, there are more people who want to appear smart. But I don't think that we descended to the noisy scenes that one hears nowadays. I do wish that more of the members in Parliament would listen, go out and listen to what goes on in the House and form their own opinion of what happens there.

Yes, well that could well be, but I think one of the problems lies in the fact that people who speak in the House should be concerned with issues, not with persons, and so long as they address themselves to issues, they're effective. So long as they descend to personalities, they're less effective. I would hope that issues would remain the important thing, rather than persons.

No, I still think Parliament and our democratic system is the best system that operates, but some of the
