Good morning to you, ??, and very happy birthday greetings to 1ZB. My association with 1ZB goes back even earlier that you mentioned in your preamble, it goes back to in fact 1937, when I was involved in the soap opera 'One Man's Family'.

That of course was a local production. It was the first local production of a soap opera. It had a fairly short life; I think it ran for about eighteen months. The scripts used to come out from America, they were adapted for the New Zealand scene, there was never, it was never set in any particular place. So the, my association goes back a very very long time in fact the thirty-nine of the forty years that 1ZB been on air, and it's been a very happy association. You mentioned 'It's in the Bag'. The very first production of 'It's in the Bag' was done in your radio theatre.

Round about 1954 I think it was.

Well in 1948, Ian ??, who was then director of programs of the old NZBF, the commercial programs, suggested I do a program call 'Poses, Penalties and Profits'. Now that was a nine week wonder. That was the first big giveaway program. We recorded it at eight o'clock and it went out on disk at nine o'clock. In fact while we were, while they were transmitting the first large disk, you remember the old thirty-three ?? disks, we were recording the second disk, and while that was going out we were recording the third disk. But that only ran for nine weeks. Don't ask me why it was ever taken off the air, because it had a terrific impact, in fact some of the small cinemas around the country, the country cinemas on Thursday nights, it was broadcast on Thursday nights, didn't bother to open the doors, because nobody was there. And up till then of course, it was a shilling and a free clean sort of quiz program. Well then John Maybury, Jack Maybury rather, Jack Maybury came into the scene, and he started with ?? Brothers about the same time, and he originated 'Luck’s/Lux Money go round', he originated 'Quiz Kids' and 'Challenge of the Cities' and other programs. Then of course he went over to Australia, and I took over his job in ??, who were the advertising agents for Levers, and I took over his program 'Luck’s Money go Round', 'Quiz Kids', which we used to do more in the Auckland 1ZB Radio Theatre than anywhere else in New Zealand, so it was virtually based on Auckland. Then my commitments became too heavy, and John Raynor?? took over 'Quiz Kids', and it was based permanently in Auckland from that moment on. Then I had to change, get a new program idea, and that's when 'It's in the Bag' came up, and that was around about 1954, and it ran, what eleven, twelve, thirteen years, and there's been a lag of nine years between that being on radio and coming onto television.

Not in the slightest. We were all, we had the same audience, the same audience would listened to his programs as listened to mine, and then of course ?? came in with later programs, and but we were, the audience was the same, it was not as it is with television now, where you are competing with one channel or one station against the other. The commercial stations had the audience, and that was it. ?? competition, and we were very great personal friends.

I wouldn't have a clue how many miles we travelled, but, but I have some very happy associations with the late Ted Thorpe, of course, who was travelled with me for years, Brian Petrie, who's now with ?? advertising. There's so many people that I have such happy memories of over these years of broadcasting and commercial broadcasting, and I personally think that commercial broadcasting is coming back.

I do. I think that the opportunity for radio, for night time radio, has never been better. I think that the standard, the general standard of television programs, that people are getting sick of blood and guts and violence and comp shows and what have you, and I think that radio has a great opportunity of coming back now and fighting against television.

The ‘Lever Head Parade’.

Well you people are still running a similar sort of program with ?? on Thursday nights I think, isn't it, that you have it on?

Radio New Zealand? And you know this program, when I see the ‘Diana Shaw Show’ I think of these days when we had Diana Shaw and Perry Como and

Rosemary Clunig, that’s great. Of course we, the pop stayed in very much longer in those days, they were at the top of the poll, for some of the times they'd go for ten or fifteen weeks.

As Mr Omo. I commuted over four years to do those commercials.

And in fact quite a number of Australians I've run into, we went for a cruise while we were doing these commercials and they said, you know they quite couldn't quite get that this New Zealander and ?? Australia, they must be very alike. Australians who remember it.

Well, it's a, it's a different aspect, ??. I was always confident that it would go well on television. I didn't think it would go as well as it has done. I think the secret of it is to play it thirteen weeks on and thirteen weeks off so that we always leave them wanting more. I wouldn't like to do it as we did it in the old days of radio, fifty-two weeks of the year, year in year out, because I think that people would tire of it more quickly on television that they would on radio, and I'm very happy there with the ratings at the moment, for some reason you good people in Auckland are letting me down, we're top rating in all centres except Auckland, In Auckland we're down about eight or tenth place, the last figures I saw. But I think that the reason for this is that Saturday night you're a more sophisticated people up there, you go out more, you've got more nightclubs, more cabarets to attract people away from television on Saturday nights, in fact now that, well I, that's the excuse I give them.

Well I don't know. We'll just keep going and as long as the public keep watching I guess. We've, I've got into a new field of course, with this 'Beauty and the Beast', the midday program which seems to have an appeal. We did a similar program, I didn't ever do it, John Raynor did it, called 'Leave it to the Girls', which was a very popular program on radio. 

And I would say that this is another opportunity for radio to come back with this sort of panel discussion. You know I really think that as far as radio's concerned and particularly the commercial radio, that you are confining yourselves too much to music. I think that people are interested, women in their homes or anybody in their homes on their own want company, and not so much the company of music, but the company of people talking and discussing problems. So there it is, if you're looking for a program idea, do a quality into the girls again on radio again.

Thank you very much ??

Goodbye everybody.




I was born Selwin Featherstone Twogood on the fourth of April 1916, at a lying in hospital at the Terrace, Wellington. The name Twogood I owe to my Scandinavian forebears. In its original form, Foregod, it commemorates the Viking god of war, and I'm sure every member of the Twogood family must have at some stage wished that our ancestors had had the good sense to stick with the original spelling. When you've lived with being called all the variations - nogood, twobig, neveranygood, all your life, you long for a simple name like, like Cholmondeley. The astonishing thing is that everybody who comes out with these witticisms believes he thought of them first. 

My Christian names, Selwyn Featherstone commemorate a bishop and a small country town respectively. The name Selwyn I owe to my maternal grandfather, George Herbert Butler. He was the epitome of the phrase 'an English gentleman', so much so that even now I haven't found out what he actually did for a living. I have a feeling he was a civil servant. I do know that he was a keen churchman and a lay reader at St Peter's Church, Willis St Wellington. And he felt it entirely fitting that his new grandson should bear the name of the good Bishop Selwyn, who was among the first to foster the growth of Christianity in New Zealand. Whether or not he had an ambition for me to take up the cloth we never discovered, although as my wife Cynthia is quick to point out, while I might have made an imposing figure as a bishop, I would surely have made a lousy curate.

How I came to be named after Featherstone, that pleasant little ?? upper township, standing in the shadow of the ?? range, takes a little longer to tell. We have to go back to my paternal grandparents. My grandfather, William Twogood, a Yorkshire mariner, decided to settle on the land. I've always believed him to have been a sea captain, but my brother Warren has recently taken up trying to convince me that he was in fact a mate. As he didn't distinguish himself in later life, I'm content to go on believing that he'd had his day of glory while at sea and retired a happy man. So I'll stick with my version of the story, thanks Warren. Captain Twogood then left the sea and brought his family out to New Zealand to settle. His wife died tragically in a house fire only a few years after they arrived, and my father really never knew her. I've always cited William as being a man of great foresight. In the first place, he swallowed the anchor because he could see no future in steamships, and in the second, he opened a drapery business in Featherstone. No sooner he had finished polishing the brand new till, and arranging the bolts of calico in the window, when at a smart clip arrived a horse and trap, bearing Alex Smith, son of James Smith, the large Wellington drapery importer. The trap was chock full of samples from the sophisticated city, which he'd painstakingly taken half a day to haul over the river ?? to peddle to the fashion starved settlers of the ??. The Featherstone ladies were drawn to Smith's trap like ants to honey, while Captain Twogood stood sadly by on the sidelines. It would be truthful to say that the ?? Trading Company, as he called his little business, failed to set the world on fire, but he was nevertheless very fond of the town of Featherstone and he named his next son, my father, Henry Featherstone Twogood after it. And my father, who recognised the beginnings of a family tradition when he saw one, responded by adding the name to the two I already had and thus I became Selwyn Featherstone Twogood before I had any say in the matter. Given the family propensity for naming the children after the location of the family business, I can only thank my lucky stars that William Twogood hadn't opened his little shop at ?? or Queen Charlotte ??
