I really have no idea, to tell you honest truth. The, when I look back on my early years, in fact look back on my parents and my grandparents, I suppose we all benefit to some degree from heredity. I had, one of my grandmothers was a rather remarkable lady from Northern Ireland. 

She was, had a great deal of spirit and strength, and determination, and she lived to a ripe old age of ninety three, and I think she was a remarkable woman actually, and I suppose my father was a, a fairly, was a very energetic and reasonable obstreperous sort of character, who did have I think a lot of drive and terrific ability to work. So I suppose inevitably one picks up some of these characteristics from one's parents and grandparents. 

I can't really, I don't really feel that there's a sort of a clear pattern emerged in my childhood, I always seemed to be in a way a bit of an outsider, I think, as far as my schooling was concerned, I was never very happy, particularly at secondary school, I certainly didn't feel that I fitted in particularly well with the school activities, and even after that, up to the age of twenty one and so on, I really felt that sort of rather a lonely, independent person, who was perhaps searching mentally for some sort of solution to some of the problems that seemed to be round about, but not by any means a mature or stable, or perhaps even a solid member of society, I just sort of was, I think uncertain, insecure, and frequently quite bloody minded in my approach to many of the problems of that day.

Yes, that's true. I, I think in many ways actually the, travelling by train as I used to do every day to Auckland Grammar, I used to catch the train at seven in the morning and get back home about six fifteen at night. In many ways particularly the trip home on the train for a couple of hours became the happiest part of the day for me, in that was the time the schoolwork was over, and what few friends I had more or less travelled on the train, I could read books quietly in a corner and we could get involved in all the skylarking and foolish things that young people do, and I really think I quite enjoyed this.

No, I would say I really can't remember too many individuals who've strongly influenced me in my life at all. I think in many ways I've been more influenced by the things I disagreed with almost than the things or the people that I strongly agreed with. This is not to say that I didn't appreciate I think, the people who were involved in my life, even though I fought with my father like fury all through my teens, I always in many ways had quite a respect for him, and a certain sense of loyalty, but that didn't mean that I didn't argue with him, which I certainly did.

Yes, my reading I suppose would be regarded as being fairly light. I found that a great deal of time, a certain stage particularly in my life, I more or less escaped from the world into the realms of imagination, and I was a tremendous reader of books like Rider Haggard and John Buchan and all those sort of rather imaginative, adventurous sort of things. 

And when I wasn't reading a book, I seemed to be a good deal of the time living in my imagination and putting myself in all sorts of fantastic, romantic situations, in which of course I was always dying heroically here or rescuing someone there. The, although I feel now that obviously one couldn't do this all one's life, because nothing whatsoever would actually happen, in many ways it was I think perhaps a useful escape, as far as I was concerned, away from a life which, in which I felt sort of repressed and subdued, and I really don't think it in the end it did too much harm.

Not so much at the time, I think. I more or less accepted the sort of John Buchan approach that the sort of, all the heroes more or less inevitably were from the upper stratas of society, and so on. But they were heroes who were painted in a sympathetic sort of a way who didn't mind perhaps sleeping with one of the lower classes and all the rest of it, they were people who would share dangers and difficulties, and I didn't find this too bad, but it was strongly counteracted by the fact of course, that I was brought up in a house that during the depression my father was, had very strong views on all sorts of social questions of course, as many New Zealanders did.

So we were intended to be swept along by this feeling of the need for social change, resentment perhaps against the establishment, which it seemed to have little sympathy for such changes, and I think these factors probably played a much bigger part in my life that books like John Buchan.

No, I don't think beekeeping had much to do with it. You know a lot of ideas about beekeeping is the sort of thing that you retire gently too, and you wander around among the flowers and so on and become philosophical. This may be true perhaps in the type of amateur beekeeping that goes on, but commercial beekeeping is quite a different proposition. It's a very high pressure, hardworking, a lot of physical energy is required, in many ways it's a lot of excitements, and disappointments. 

The honey crop comes along and all the hives swarm at once, and you're working twenty hours a day to secure your honey crop. And then of course bad weather comes and next moment you're not getting any crop at all. And in many ways I enjoyed this challenge, and even the disappointments, you're always optimistic that next week things will be better, or next year there'll be a better crop. And even though this life was a very uncertain one, and money was very uncertain indeed in our household, I really think on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed the beekeeping, and I enjoyed throwing myself physically, almost violently physically into the physical work involved.

The, my brother and I used to always race each other, carrying loads. We rarely ever carried an eighty-pound box of honey just walking, we would jog, and if we weren't racing each other we'd be racing against the clock. I don't know why we did it, really, but this, to us at the time this added sort of a spice of life to the whole thing, and we certainly did put out a great deal of physical effort.

No I don't think it was the reflective aspect at all that appealed to me, I didn't even think of it being reflective. It was the once again, I think the opportunity for freedom of action and for energetic violent exercise, I think this is very, was a very important factor. I really started largely by initially tramping when my, I think probably eighteen or nineteen I did quite a bit of tramping in the ?? with a group of young people, and I enjoy just sort of bashing around and driving myself. 

I'd found I was reasonably energetic physically, and never seemed to run out of energy much, and I enjoyed just pushing myself and rushing around the country and when I changed to mountaineering at a later date, the, there's no doubt at all in a way I think was more a personal challenge more than anything else, the fact of constantly being scared and yet not permitting this to stop you going on, as it were, and the, although I was constantly dissatisfied perhaps with what I did or was able to do, I always liked to feel at the end of a climb even though I'd been petrified half the time, firstly that I hadn't shown it too much, and secondly that I had been able to keep going and in the end sort of reached the top or whatever we were doing.

 So there's no doubt at all that the challenge of it, the physical discomfort and even the fear involved in it was one of the substantial attractions. Of course I enjoyed the views and the comradeship and so on of other members of the party, this was tremendously important, but there's no doubt too that the sense of challenge and the sense of achieving that you get by overcoming your fears was quite a considerable factor.

Oh Harry had a terrific influence on me. Till I met Harry the, he was just a name, he was sort of the most famous of all New Zealand climbers at the time. And I had been doing some quite nice little climbing round about the place and feeling reasonably pleased with myself, but meeting up with Harry and climbing with Harry sort of moved me up into a different league, as it were, and I learnt a tremendous lot from climbing with him.

 He's, I still regard him as one of the finest technical climbers that I have ever met, and his skills, which of course to some degree are different from the skills of a modern day climber, because techniques have changed, but I haven't the slightest doubt if he'd been climbing today he'd be equally competent and as a modern climber with these skills, and head and shoulders above the vast majority.

Well I had my, you know I wondered a bit just what the effect would be. I always remember we, when we joined up with the party, Earl Ridderford?? and I, a northern New Zealander, we had come in after the, Eric Shipton's party, and we crossing through Nepal in the Monsoon. And in order to catch up with them in a high village, we did about a two days march and we left some of our loads behind and we ground up this tremendously long hill for about five thousand feet, where we knew they were. 

And I always remember as we approached the village just wondering whether all my sort of ideals were going to be dissipated by meeting Eric, but no, this wasn't the case at all. For some reason because these were the first English climbers really I'd ever had anything to do with, I think I expected them to be dressing for dinner, and being frightfully pukka and all the rest of it, while I can assure you I'd never seen anything as decrepit looking than Eric Shipton was. And he had a great, very very easy manner and great warmth, and so on, and before long we were very much one of the party. 

The thing was that I discovered with Eric and ?? of every person of any consequence, they have various aspects of various things in which they excel. And they are human, so that in many ways they are far less competent and as I discovered with Eric that some things he's not terribly good at, that some things I was a lot better at that he was. But as far as the spirit driving him on to explore, the desire to look over into the next valley, to climb the next peak and so on, I don't think I've ever met anybody with a stronger spirit than this, and he was reported to prepare to put up with any discomfort and hardship in his desire to explore. So this was a thing I had to respect and enjoy, and no Eric was a great, it was life to me, the time I spent with Eric Shipton, he is quite a remarkable man.

I don't really think I thought too deeply about it. Initially I found it difficult to accept the emotional reaction sort of that the world seemed to have at the time at our particular success. It did all seem a bit on the exaggerated side, after all amongst ourselves we all agreed that what we just climbed a mountain was a big one, and we felt quite a lot of the satisfaction out of doing it.

 But we did realise very quickly that we climbed the right mountain at the right time. The world seemed to want people to have done something like that at that time, so I think perhaps we benefited a great deal from the right climate as it were, in world feelings. I've always rather in a sense not resented, but disliked the suggestion that because you climbed something like Everest or do something else similar, that life more or less stops then, that you spend the rest of your life referring back to the day you did this particular feat. 

I certainly refuse to either accept this or do it. I realise that the climb of Everest was a tremendously important occasion for me, it made a great deal of difference about what I did in later life, but I like to feel that it was just one incident, perhaps, in a sort of a long line of incidents which I hope will go on for a quite a lot longer.

No, I don't feel nostalgic in the slightest. Everest you see is a……HILLARY 722
Hello boys and girls. The last time I spoke on this session I was here with George Lowe, who I'm sure you'll all remember, and we were talking about the climb of Mount Everest. This time, both George Lowe and myself are rather turning our thoughts in another direction; we're both planning to go down to the Antarctic. As you probably all know, the Antarctic lies almost due south of New Zealand here, and in fact New Zealand is one of the countries which is closest to the Antarctic of any land. In our day, in science magazines and in comics, there's a lot of talk about trips to Mars, and we're always seeing pictures of space men with glass bowls on their head. Well a trip into the Antarctic is just as much of a journey into the unknown. It's not a journey through millions of miles of space, but sort of backwards through millions of years of time, into the Ice Age. Because down in the Antarctic, there's an enormous continent that's bigger than the whole of the United States. But most of it is covered with snow and ice, and some of the snow and ice is thousands of feet thick. However, it's not by any means all covered with snow and ice, and in places there are large mountain ranges, pushing their way up through the ice, and there it is possible to see just exactly what the rock is like, to examine it, and see if there's anything really worthwhile there in the form of minerals. 

Now when you go down to the Antarctic, you can expect all sorts of weird circumstances. For instance, in the Antarctic Summer, there is no night at all. There's daylight all the time, so when you want to go to bed, you just set your clock and decide you're going to go to bed at ten o’clock, and even though it's still bright and daylight all around, you go to bed and have your sleep. In the same way, during the Antarctic Winter, there's no daylight at all, and for about three long months, you don't see the sun, and it's just dark. Now this seems to be the most difficult time of all for men down there, because it's very difficult for them to move around, extremely cold, and so they are confined most of the time to their huts. And during this time they have to keep busy, otherwise they all might get rather worried, and fret a lot, and be no use at all in the summer.

Now the reason that we are going down on a New Zealand expedition, I think we really have three main reasons. First of all, there is the fact that we have been given a very important job to assist the British trans-Antarctic expedition. Now this is an expedition that's crossing from one side of the Antarctic continent to the other. It's a trip of nearly two thousand miles over snow and ice, and it includes going through the South Pole. Well this has never been done before, although many men have dreamt about it and planned to do it in the past fifty years. 

The best-known man of these was the famous explorer Shackleton. In 1914, he made a plan up to go from one side to thee other of the Antarctic continent and he set off in one ship to one side of the continent, and he sent another ship to the other side. Well unfortunately his own ship, down in the Weddell Sea, it was caught in the ice, frozen in, and then some wind started blowing and the ice was all tossed around and resulted in the ship being completely crushed, and it sank. Oh but Shackleton was a remarkable leader, and he got all his men safely out onto the ice, and they sailed on some ice flows?? for many months, until finally they reached the open sea, and he was able to launch the small boats they had with them, and they got in these and sailed across the very stormy oceans indeed to finally reach safety. But of course this meant that they hadn't been successful in crossing the continent. Well in the next few years the, his plan is going to be attempted again, this time by a British expedition. A party from the United Kingdom is going down to ?? bay, which is really south of South Africa, and down there they are going to establish a base, and then from that base, using vehicles, ?? vehicles, specially made for crossing snow and ice, they're going to attempt to go over that two thousand mile trip, to the South Pole, to the opposite side of the continent. Included in that crossing party is our own New Zealander, George Lowe. And he's going along, because of course he's a very experienced man with snow and ice in the Himalayas, but also because he's an expert for movie photographer, and he'll be taking a record of the trip all the way through.

Now from New Zealand, we have a very useful job to do in respect to the trans-Antarctic expedition, because we've been given the job of support, from the New Zealand end. South of us, south of New Zealand, there is the Ross Sea dependency which we claim as belonging to New Zealand, and we are going down in that dependency to establish a base at a place called ??. Down here we'll build this base, and from it we'll start trips out onto the Polar plateau, making dumps of food and fuel out towards the South Pole. The idea is that when the trans Antarctic expedition crosses through the south pole, and starts heading towards ??, it will be extremely short on food and fuel, by that time, no doubt, all the men will be rather tired and done in, and our job is to go out and meet them as far out as we can, to give them food and fuel and to help them back over the last hundreds of miles of difficult going, down to ??. And then the whole lot of us will return back to New Zealand. 

We regard this as a very important job, because we know that in as much as we have to ?? these dumps to food and fuel, well the lives of the trans Antarctic expedition will depend upon us doing the job well. If they cross through the pole and don't manage to find the food and fuel, well they might never reach back to civilisation again. However we're going down for other reasons too. We claim this area in the Antarctic, and we feel now that it's going to be necessary to explore it, to map it, and to examine all the rocks and so on, just to find out exactly what there is down there. This is going to be a very long job because there's a mountain range in the Ross dependency which is a thousand miles long, which is as long as the, from one end to the other of New Zealand, and it won't be possible for us of course to examine every part of this just in one year, but we do hope to examine quite a lot of it, to explore some of the valleys, to climb up the glaciers and make quite a good map anyway, of the area through which we're going. 

Now we intend to use down there a combination of methods of travelling around. You know in the old days of Scott, and Shackleton and Amundsen, when they were making their attempts to get to the South Pole, well they used as a method of transport either ponies, mules or dogs. Well Amundsen who finally reached the Pole first, he used dogs, and it was found that that was a much more, much easier form of transport, and a much more efficient one. Well even nowadays, some forty years after, dogs and dog teams, are regarded as the most efficient form of transport over very rough ground. If you can get easy and flat going, then it's possible to use vehicles, with the tractor treads on them, and they of course can move much more quickly than dogs. But in the territory where we're going, the ground is very rough indeed, so we know we can't get vehicles over it, and we intend using the faithful old dog. Well we're going to have a lot of dogs. We think we'll be taking about fifty to sixty dogs down with us, and we'll make these dogs into teams of about nine dogs per team, and we hope to have about six teams. Each team, of course, will pull a sledge. It's really quite astonishing what these huskies will pull. Well if you get a fully loaded sledge, loaded up with food and fuel, weighing about fourteen hundred pounds, over half a ton, well these nine dogs will pull it quite readily, and pull it for day after day. It just shows how strong they are. Well we're not only going to have dogs and sledges, we're going to combine them with the use of aircraft. That was the aircraft ?? thing of course, that Scott and Shackleton and Amundsen didn't have, and that's where we have a big advantage nowadays. These aircraft will be used for the carrying of stores. What will happen is that some of us will take several dog teams, laden down with supplies, and then we'll climb up these glaciers making slow time in the difficult conditions, and when we're about a hundred miles out, or so, we'll send a signal with our little radio back to base, tell them that we have found a place where it's possible for an aircraft to land. Well immediately the aircraft will get loaded up with half a ton of supplies and it'll fly out and join us and land with its skis on the snow, and we'll take all the food out, and then it'll go back for more. In this way we'll be able to build up a dump of supplies, and as soon as there's enough food there, we'll load up the dog teams again, and go on further. Actually we've tried out some of these aircrafts landing on skis only a short while ago, I was down in the southern alps, and in an aircraft there we made the first landings that have ever been made on skis in the New Zealand Alps. Now it really was very exciting indeed. We took off from a little aerodrome, and then the wheels were pulled up and the skis were put in place and we flew up the Tasman glacier, and then landed without any trouble at all at a height of about five thousand feet. Actually I think landing on the snow was much easier than landing anywhere else. But getting off the snow was a much harder business. We turned the aircraft down and started off down the glacier with the engine going as hard as we could, but we went for about a mile and we still couldn't take off, and we wondered a bit whether we were ever going to get off, and finally after we'd done about a mile and a half we seemed to get enough speed up, and the snow flying in every direction, finally we took off the snow, up into the air. Now from that we learnt a good deal, and by now we know it is quite possible to take off and land on the snow quite safely at heights up to seven and eight thousand feet. 

Well we were hoping that the expedition that goes down from New Zealand will be very well equipped indeed, because we have the advantage of all the experience and information that has been gained from Antarctic expeditions over many, many years in the past. And the sort of clothing we'll be wearing, we'll have on our feet of course very warm boots because one of the hardest things to keep warm are your feet. We'll have several types of boots. Some boots are rather like a ski boot, in which you will just wear, say three pairs of socks inside an ordinary leather boot, but this is for just around about camp. When you get into the really cold conditions, you use a boot called a ??. That's rather an unusual name, but it's a name for a boot in which you have a sort of a canvas cover, with a little rubber sole on the bottom, but it's a very large boot indeed, and inside it you wear a couple of pairs of socks, then two or three sort of inner soles made of felt. And these inner boots made of felt keep your feet very warm indeed. Well as well as that, of course, we have windproof clothing, which cover you up from the very strong, cold winds, and then probably the most, the warmest piece of equipment of the lot, are our eiderdown jackets and trousers. These down jackets and trousers are about two inches thick, they're very light indeed and they're full of feather down and they certainly keep you warm under even the most difficult conditions. I have found it very interesting to compare the type of equipment we used in the Himalayas, with that that we'll be using down in the Antarctic. Much of it is very similar indeed. Except that in the Himalayas, where you’re climbing at great altitudes, the main trouble is that you can't carry much because you're relatively weak. So you're very keen indeed to get equipment that is very light, and yet very efficient. Well down in the Antarctic we'll be at much lower levels, and we will have the help of dogs and aircrafts to carry our equipment, so lightness in equipment is perhaps not quite so important. What is more important is that the equipment could be very strong and rugged so that it can last for several years of wear. So our equipment down south will be very strong, well made, and of course capable of combating the tremendous cold that we'll have down there.

Well this gives you some idea of what we have in mind. We're going to have a party of about twenty two men and we're going to spend the long winter nights down there, when there's no daylight at all, preparing for the extensive work we intend doing in the spring. We intend leaving our base and heading out for hundreds of miles onto the Polar Plateau, using our aircraft for supplying us with food and fuel, and we hope to lay bases out as far as we can towards the South Pole, so that we can meet the trans-Antarctic party and bring them safely back to base.
No, I don't feel nostalgic in the slightest. Everest, you see is a great chunk of a mountain, rather ugly really as mountains go, and I think all of those who get involved on it spend so much of their time being miserable and sort of feeling nauseated or short of breath or being in incredibly squalid camps for week after week that even though one may reach the top and have a great sense of achievement and so on, I find it difficult to imagine that anybody could really have a nostalgic feeling towards the mountain. 

There's so many other mountains that are more beautiful and where one perhaps has a more relaxed and happier time on them that, no, I look on Everest still as a tremendous challenge, a foreboding peak in many ways, that still seems just about as hard to climb really as it was in our day, and it's so big and so overwhelming as far as logistics are concerned. It's not a peak you sort of pat on the head and say 'Good boy' and like it. No it's sort of almost rather, a frightening in many ways.

No, I don't quite know what you mean there, but the, I look back on the Antarctic thing more as a succession of incidents almost, rather than sort of one major sort of objective as we had with Everest. The problems are different, the problems are more ones of great distance, of logistics and of carefully working out plans the immediate dangers vary, I mean the I don't think perhaps you're in such dangerous terrain for as long as you are on a mountaineering expedition, but then you have the problem of travelling with vehicles over hundreds of miles of crevassed country and so on, which is very nerve wracking. I would, think that the Antarctic to me gave many incidents and many occasions where we had challenges and we had comradeship and where we had exciting moments and so on, but it never really did for me come together as one great sort of particular challenge.

I don't really know that it's got much to do with the question of whether they are climbers or scientists, because many people are both. And but I think it does make a difference of course, working with different types of people. The, I had, in many ways I think you've perhaps chosen the wrong two people. There are many things about Eric Shipton you see in his planning of trips which I heartily disagreed with. I always remember on one occasion, he wasn't good at, for instance organising food for an expedition, in fact because he didn't particularly like food, he didn't enjoy food, he'd eat anything that was going, so he didn't select good food.

 And in one, one of the members of the expedition was asked on the BBC as to what were the main things in organising the food, and referring to Eric's expedition he said 'Well, the main thing is there should be some', and Eric sometimes didn't have enough food, so that was a thing in which he was in my view very weak. But then he had these other aspects which were almost inspirational, in the way that he had this tremendous drive and this enthusiasm, a lot of warmth to carry his party along. Vivian Fuchs of course was quite a different type.


He didn't have the sort of warmth aspect at all, he was much more methodical, almost laborious perhaps in some of his working out of problems, and much more difficult I think to really feel, certainly me, anyway, who is a rather perhaps erratic type, I found it more difficult to be motivated perhaps by a Fuchs than I am by a Shipton. I don't think there's any question about that.

Well I suppose it's the end of a chain almost, the, on the various expeditions that I've been involved in, of course I'd had close associations with our Sherpas, and I became very very friendly indeed with quite a few of the our Sherpa porters and our climbers, and when we went down into the villages we were given hospitality in the homes of the Sherpas and so on, and we developed a considerable affection for them, and of course, living in their homes, you couldn't help but notice the perhaps the disadvantages that we would regard that they had, the lack of any education for their children, the certain amount of lack of hygiene, the no opportunity for treatment for diseases, and then even more forcibly, I suppose, for a couple of years there, there were occasions in which Sherpas I'd been very friendly with either would die suddenly, or their families would die.


 I remember one year going back, and in the house of one of the Sherpas, his child, who he'd been very proud of, who I'd sort of jogged around on my knee on this occasion, I arrived back next year and the child was dead. And obviously nothing had been possible to do about it. So in the end I think my the big step that I really made was from feeling sorry about it actually to doing something about it. And this all came about largely with talking to the Sherpas, and it suddenly seemed to me well, why in the heck wasn't I trying to do something, because the money involved was so small compared to what we regarded as was necessary to do these things. 


So that was why in 1960, 61 I raised the funds for a school in the village of ??, and we worked with the local people and in the end we established our first school up there. And this sort of thing has escalated now, we've got fourteen of these little schools all over the place, and I really feel that you more or less could go on indefinitely as long as you had the money to do it. But I think that, I don't like to feel and I'm sure it's not true, that we're doing these things in a sense of being do-gooders. I think first of all, the main thing is I never tried to inflict a school or a hospital or anything else on a village, I think it's rather, some people wander into a village and they look around and they, in their supreme arrogance they say right, well you need a school there and you need something else there and you need something else there and all the rest of it. 

Well I don't agree with this approach at all. I think you can possibly persuade people that they might be a good idea, but in general I wait until I've been approached on a number of occasions by a village asking for assistance to work on these projects. And when they have offered to contribute, the only thing they have really which is their labour free, only then do I feel that we can sort of get to grips with the problem and work with them on it, and then it is very satisfying, because we are working with the local people on a, on their own project.

Well, I think there are a lot of individuals, actually, who are making tremendous efforts to help. And a lot of these individuals are in ?? positions, sometimes they are important people in the community. I do not however feel that the, humanity as a whole, that we're really getting to grips with the problems anywhere near as enthusiastically as we could. Even in our own society there's no question still that rugby, racing, going to the beach and all the rest of it are the dominant factors in our lives. 

And although there's nothing much wrong with these things, I just suggest that perhaps we should be devoting a little bit more thought, instead of just talking about the problems in our community and the problems in the world in general. We should be devoting a little more thought, a little bit more effort and a jolly sight more money to doing something about it. You know we don't like to talk about money when we're referring to social problems and so on, as long as ?? to do it. But after all, money does represent what we can do in our community, and unless we're prepared to put out the money, and make a little bit of a sacrifice, obviously you're not going to do anything at all.

Yes, I would indeed, actually. I think that, you know to make these, my experience has been that to make substantial changes, to vow to do a substantial amount of help, it's surprising how little money you can create a change. We don't always just have to think in hundreds of millions of dollars, it's quite surprising how in a good little project, with a small amount of money, you can have a bit of an impact. 

Yes, I'm inclined to think that's true. I think that the attitudes of changing over from talking about things and deploring things to saying 'well, let’s do something about it' is probably the single biggest step our society can take. Now I feel this is particularly true in New Zealand. The, we get little, almost no what I would call inspirational and motivational action from government, for instance. I think that nearly all the really good projects that have taken place from New Zealand are started by individuals. 

They get support and very good support frequently from the public, they almost invariably have the greatest of ?? in getting any support from government. I would like to think that in a country such as ours that it would be possible to have a little bit of inspiration from the top, perhaps a little bit of active assistance that wasn't expected, maybe, instead of having to have this constant battle with officialdom, to try and get financial support for what's something which everybody agrees is a worthwhile project.

Goodness alone know, actually, I suppose the only effective way in a democracy is by, is through the power of the voter. But I think in many ways it's unfortunate the way in our society that we are constantly being forced to form pressure groups in order to combat some other pressure group and get the sort of the national cake cut in a reasonable sort of a way. I am one of those who really feel it would be marvellous or and on the few occasions that we do get someone who is prepared to sort of lead the country a little bit, I think it's absolutely marvellous. I only wish we had more of it.

Well I, I do have quite a lot to do with young people and sort of having young family of my own, so I tend to get involved in it to some degree. My wife and I always say that you know you read that the teenage time is the time in which the young people really learn the most. Well we have found of course that the teenage time is when their parents really learn the most and this is, I'm not really joking, this is absolutely true. We've learnt a great deal in communication?? with young people and are still learning of course.

 I feel that the young people of today are more honest in their assessment of many of the problems, they are franker in facing up to them, it's not a different, not a easy time for people to live, I don't think, the even the affluence of our society I think can bring many problems. I admire many of our young people today. Some of them are incredibly stupid, of course but so they have always been in all ages of our society. I would like to see the change, and this is where I think perhaps the responsibility rests very much with the older generation to try and, I feel that all of us have a, have rights in society, but we also of course have responsibilities and this is I think perhaps where the older generation should try by some means to get the message home to the young people as well that they have their rights, they have the right to be heard, I think, their views to be at least sensibly considered, but I do think also that they have their responsibilities, and sort of the even protest is OK.


 But protest without the desire to contribute, to my mind is, is rather lacking in any sort of effectiveness and I think that we can get our young people with their good ideas, with their often clear thinking, I think, about many of our problems, their refusals to accept the status quo as being right because that's what we happen to have, if we can get them sufficiently motivated to get ??? and to do something, then I think we may be starting to get somewhere.

Well I don't have the slightest doubt about that really. The thing that's given me the greatest satisfaction questionably is not climbs of mountains or activities in Antarctic, it is undoubtedly my activities, as far as assistance programs are concerned particularly with the Sherpas, and I think if you know, when I sort of kick the bucket as it were, of all the things that I would really like to be kept going, the things that I'd really like to feel had some continuing activity would unquestionably be my Sherpas schools and so on.

Thank you.
We had, even at quite early stages, quite fierce arguments. My father was a very firm gentleman, maybe perhaps a little bit harsh at times, and I certainly, if it was a matter of disagreement used to end up in the woodshed with my father, getting thumped. In a way I think it almost became a battle of wills.


In that the main thing my father really wanted was for me to admit that I had done something wrong, where I was absolutely determined, whether I had done it wrong or not that I was not going to admit it. And in actual fact I don't think I ever did admit my, the error of my ways, rightly or wrongly. I don't think this is a necessarily a particularly worthy approach on my part, but it's perhaps showed that I


had quite a stubborn will anyway, even in those days. I must have been a very uncomfortable child, I think, for my parents.

Yes, my mother really was the more the inspirational side of our family activity. She'd been a school teacher, she was very anxious that her three children should be well educated, even though this meant a considerable drain on the family finances in years when we didn't have any finances


and I think that all we three children were very thankful of her determination that we should be well educated, even though my father frequently said 'Oh, we simply can't afford to send so and so to such and such a school, it'd be much better if he came home and worked and helped with the getting of food and all the rest of it'. But my mother, who was a much quieter person but who will prevailed in these things, and all of us ended up by going to reasonable education


Yes, I was sort of the child genius of the ?? Primary school. I think because my mother was a schoolteacher she sort of pumped me full of I would’ve thought rather useless information, but I did have a lot of general information. And the teachers at ?? Primary school sort of liked teaching me, because I could absorb it relatively easily


So instead of completing ?? Primary school at the average age of thirteen, I passed at the age of eleven. And with great determination from my mother, who was determined I was going to go to a good school in Auckland, we lived forty miles out in ??, I went to Auckland Grammar. I was a very unhappy child at Auckland Grammar. It really had nothing to do with Auckland Grammar, I think I would have been inevitably unhappy all through my


secondary school period, one reason being that being much younger than the average in the school, I felt I was small, I was sort of rather helpless, I came from a country school, even at primary school I had learnt nothing about things like French, or even any advanced sort of mathematics. So I was thrust into this rather more high-powered environment in Auckland Grammar


and for a while I really found it quite a struggle. But when I look back on it, I really didn't do too badly at Auckland Grammar. I certainly wasn't one of the bright students, I was just a very mediocre one. But I did end up getting my matriculation, and university entrance, so I couldn't have been a no-hoper anyway.


Yeah, well I mean because I was very young, I was much smaller than the average child in my class. But I think it probably when I was in about the fourth form, or maybe the fifth form, I suddenly started growing, and I grew six inches in one year and five inches in the next year. And so towards the end of my time at Grammar, I was definitely one of the larger boys there. And so this sort of changed my attitude physically, anyway, and I also knew by that time that


I was physically energetic, and robust, and every spare moment away from school I was working with my father in the bees doing hard physical labour. It's why I think that I, by the end of the school period, I was, I was a physically strong person, not particularly good athletically, but just physically robust.


Now this actually affected and still affects really the whole of my attitude to life.

It was, it was when I first went to Grammar and we all had to go along to the gymnasium really to be assessed for training and what procedures would be carried out on us. And this gymnastics instructor, who I regard as one of the more unpleasant teachers that I ever had anything to do with


when we stripped off sort of business, and he looked at me and I can clearly remember him looking at me with scorn and saying to me 'What will they send to me next', and he told me that I had bulging rib cages and my back wasn't very straight, and he just about told me everything that was terrible about my physical set-up. Now this created in me


I mean I was absolutely mortified, of course. And this created in me an enormous sense of inferiority, which even although I have developed into a somewhat large and robust person, I still retain, and personally still retain, I still think I'm a rather strange looking character, and even though I know you know, I'm reasonably normal, except rather large.

I think actually that this initial approach built up


even in those early days, and remember I was only eleven at that stage, I built up a determination to be reasonably competent physically in some form or another. Because of the fact that I, for three and a half years I travelled by train every day from ?? to Auckland Grammar and back again which meant virtually four hours a day I was on the train. I wasn't really able to take parts in much sports and


as a consequence, really I had to entertain myself in the physical way, so I did a tremendous amount of walking and rushing around over the fields and jumping over fences and so on, and I think I got reasonably fit and certainly active in that fashion. But towards my later days at high school and early days at university, I sort of took lessons in jujitsu and boxing, and


I remember one occasion was in the Auckland gymnasium I think it was in those days, while I was taking boxing lessons. And the New Zealand welterweight professional champion, a very strong looking gentleman, also trained in this particular place. Now I was by then larger than he was and with a great deal longer reach, and the gentleman who ran the museum, he asked amongst us if some of us would like to do a bit of sparring to, with the, this professional boxer


now just you know so he could get experience and practice and all the rest of it. Well I said 'Yeah, why not', you know he didn't look all that tough to me sort of business. So we went into the ring and he, we sparred around a bit and he was obviously infinitely stronger and much more adept that I was, but he was a little bit careless and he dropped his guard, and I had a rather good straight left, and I reached out and I whanged him good and properly on the nose.


Now I discovered that it really isn't a good idea to hit a very tough professional boxer on the nose very firmly. He absolutely lost his temper and he laid into me and finally delivered a most tremendous uppercut to my solar plexus and I doubled up and that was the end of that little episode for me. And the instructor kept saying to me 'You silly boy


Why did you punch him on the nose?' Well I mean I thought that was what I was supposed to do, but I discovered that was not a wise thing to do to a professional boxer.

Yes indeed.

I think I, yes, I didn't deliberately want to be a loner, but because of the, the life I was leading, and the fact that I was constantly, really didn't have much to do with the kids at school because I was going back home to ?? all the time


I did build up a few friendships with the young people on the train, who were also travelling distances, but I travelled further than everybody else, so I suppose in a way I didn't have the social relationships which people tend to build up at their secondary school level. So I really left Auckland Grammar without you know, a real friend in the world, I'd have said.


Yes my parents I would have said were, had, what I would call firm, they were very supportive of the Church of England, and but were not exactly what I would have said were deeply religious people. My father got involved in the administration


of the church in ??, sufficiently so that he was one of the lay representatives who used to go to the meetings of the?? in Auckland. And he was always a great organiser and a great enthusiast on principles and all the rest of it, so he was a strong person in that respect. So we children all went along to church regularly. I never felt


tremendously motivated by it, but it was more or less a thing to do. However our, I always remember that at one stage we were passed through a series of courses by the local minister so that we could be confirmed. And the Bishop was going to come out, so it was going to be a big deal. But anyway, this minister was a very great enthusiast for his religion and I think he got a little bit carried away


in that he absolutely convinced me, anyway, that when I was confirmed in the church I would undoubtedly receive the Holy Ghost. Now I didn't quite know what the Holy Ghost was, but obviously it was going to completely change my life. And so on the day of the confirmation I went along to Church full of anticipation of a change in the rather mediocre person I regarded myself as.


and I duly went through the confirmation ceremony, which was very nicely handled by the bishop and all the rest of it and then I came away from the church and I suddenly realised that I wasn't any different. I wasn't nobler, I didn't have any greater powers, I really wasn't any different from what I'd been before. And I think that was when my first doubts about the whole, the system tended to be eroded more than somewhat. I did pass through a phase in which I
While we can maintain an era of high prices, we must have prosperity. But if prosperity is due to high prices, how can the Government claim credit for it? Is it entitled to claim credit for prosperity such as it is, if that prosperity is due, as ?? Sullivan says it is to high prices? But I want to ask you a more important question. If, in fact, our prosperity is due to the high prices we see for our primary products, what's going to happen if prices fall? And they have already fallen. Butter, not in New Zealand, but in London, is down in price. So is cheese, so is dried milk, so is ewe mutton and pork. And the other day you would notice that the opening sale, wool sale at Dunedin the price of fine wool was down between sixpence and tenpence a pound. Now the Government is significantly and discreetly silent about this, sir. It's had nothing to say about these falling prices. And I want to ask the Government, if our prosperity is due to high prices, and prices are already on the wane, how is the, how does the Government propose to maintain our prosperity if prices continue to fall? And we've had no answer to that one from any governments, because, including the Prime Minister himself. No sir. We claim that the National Party stands indicted before the people of this country because it has failed to carry out its election pledges, and I don't want to go through them tonight. All I want to say is that no more preposterous claim has been made by any political party than is being made by the National Party at the present time, that it has carried out its election pledges. That Party, sir, has completely failed to carry out some of the most salient points in his political program, some of the pledges that won it the treasury benches in this country in 1949 and continued in his office in 1951. It was only because people believed in those pledges that they voted for the Government. And for the Government to claim today as it is claiming, that it has maintained, it has kept its pledges to the people of this country is, as I say, one of the most preposterous claims that has ever been put before the electors of this country. We say too, the Government has failed, as it promised, to reduce living costs. My word, there is a very interesting story concerning living costs. I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but I have here some figures, and they are utterly reliable figures, and completely up to date. They apply to Auckland, and what applies to Auckland is likely to apply to most towns in New Zealand. And here are the comparative figures. I give you first of all meat. Take rolled?? veal for example, the last time the last controlled price under Labour, it was elevenpence a pound, today two and fourpence. Rump steak; the last controlled price under Labour was one and eightpence, today, three and fourpence. A sirloin was one and tuppence, now two and fourpence. Corn silverside was one and tuppence ha'penny, now two and tuppence. Loin of pork was one and fivepence, now three and fivepence. See how they have redeemed their promise, sir of reducing living costs in this country, making the pound go further, stabilising, stabilising the value of your money and your earnings? And what of groceries? I'll only mention three lines. I'll only mention three lines of groceries, but here they are. Chocolate biscuits of a certain brand were two and fivepence per pound last under control. Today, the same brand of biscuit, four and a penny a pound. Wine?? biscuits which were a shilling, now two and tuppence. A tin of apricot jam, of the same brand and size, at costs under Labour two and sevenpence, costs under National today, three and tenpence ha'penny. But what of fish? My word, there's a story. I don't know what your position is in ?? If it's any cheaper than it is in the major cities of this country, then you're a very fortunate people. But here ?? well I'm surprised. I'm surprised that you would eat fish even on Friday if it's any dearer, if it's any dearer than it is in Wellington or Auckland. But here is the Auckland price, sir. Snapper, whole snapper, the last controlled price sevenpence a pound; today one and sixpence a pound. And incidentally, the fisherman gets sixpence, provided he guts the fish. Cherokee, cherokee fillets were one and tuppence ha'penny, now two and sixpence. The fisherman, the fisherman again, the fisherman gets sixpence provided he guts it. ?? steaks were one and fivepence, now two and ninepence, and of that, of that, of that what's it in ?? 

Three and tuppence in ?? Well there you are, there you are. That shows how fortunate the people of Auckland are, at least compared to the people of ??, but it shows how unfortunate the people of New Zealand are today compared with what they were when fish was controlled as it was controlled under Labour. 

My only comment on that suggestion is that some people would say that's too good for him. Now to get back to the price of fish, sir. Sole was one and a penny ha'penny a pound under controlled, now three shillings, and the fishermen gets one and tuppence for that sole. I mention these figures, sir, and I tell you there are lots of people who are interested, plenty of others, but I mention these figures in order to demonstrate just how much prices have risen since this government became the government of this country and controls of certain prices were abandoned. I want to suggest to you, that a government which has failed to keep its pledge of maintaining the peoples’ purchasing power at a stable level, is not entitled to the continued support of the people of this country. It has failed, as I have said, to maintain the value of money. If you had one hundred pounds in your savings bank in 1949, that money today if you would ?? it, would buy sixty pounds worth of goods. Forty pounds would have been stolen from you as effectively as if it had been taken out of your pocket. Sixty pounds today compared with one hundred pounds in 1949. And I want, sir, to draw attention to some of the extravagance and waste that has been going on under this government. They said that taxation in New Zealand was too high and so they would reduce it. You know what it was in Labour's last year of office? All taxations, including social security, one hundred and thirty-five million pounds. You know what it is this year? It's been reduced. It's two hundred and fourteen million pounds. Two hundred and fourteen million pounds. But is it any wonder that taxation is high when these things are happening? Now, we had a visit from her gracious Majesty the Queen, and nobody will say that any legitimate expendage that was incurred in providing adequate hospitality for Her Majesty and those associated with her while she was here, should not have been so spent. No New Zealander will claim that. But I want to tell you this, and I think most people would find it pretty hard to justify. There were between seventy and eighty press representatives from overseas travelling with the royal party. This government decided that it would pay all their hotel expenses and all their transport charges from one end of this country to the other. They are the representatives of some of the wealthiest newspaper concerns in the world, and yet the taxpayers of this country have been called upon to pay the expenses of up to eighty representatives of the press, and I am going to say here tonight that nobody can possibly justify

I can't say what's responsible for this attitude of mine on the part of the public, but the fact remains that there is a considerable section of the community which thinks that parliament ought to govern. I've taken every opportunity I can of pointing out that eighty people of very different views, eighty-four now, simply can't run the country. They must delegate their powers to a smaller group, and that smaller group being the group which the majority in parliament, the government side of the House appoints as the cabinet. It's the cabinet which runs the country, not Parliament.

I don't think I used the term 'major subjects', and in any case a lot depends on what you mean by that term. I've had the feeling for some time that one of the problems is that parties, this applies to the National Party and the Labour Party in New Zealand, put too much into their policy. In other words, they commit themselves to too much beforehand. And the member feels that having been committed to these different lines of action, he is bound, when he speaks on these matters in the House, to support them through thick and thin, not withstanding the fact that circumstances may have changed to justify his taking a different attitude. Now I can't help feeling that we need more of the British attitude here. I would remind you for example that in connection with Britain's entry into the common market, there is quite a strong and influential body of opinion, including the former president of the Board of Trade, Mr Douglas Jay, which is opposed to Government policy in this connection. Now this is a really big issue, and an issue on which apparently back bench members of both parties feel that they have a perfect right to express a viewpoint in view of the fact that there is, in the country, so much controversy on this issue. And you imagine in New Zealand if members were permitted to express their individual viewpoints rather than the Party viewpoints on ??

Well when you say we have had change, yes there has been change, but in this connection may I say that what always puzzles, what has puzzled me recently is why the agitation that has grown so strongly now didn't happen ten years ago.

Oh yes, I think that's true, I think that's, that must be true of the government, particularly if its majority is narrowing, and it ought also to be true of the Opposition.

Well I can see the difficulty. I think that once a member or at least a candidate for Parliament stands on the platform of a particular party which has pledged itself to carry out a particular piece of legislation, or to undertake a matter of administration, he is bound to support that policy, his electors expect him to do so. On the other hand, I think that if parties left to the parliament of the day the decision on other issues, in which it didn't feel it necessary to make a party stand at the time of the election, we'd get much more freedom in parliament, and I think Parliament would be listened to with much more interest than is the case at the present time where people have the attitude that, well their minds are made up beforehand anyway, they can't say what they really think, we don't know what this fellow really means, even though what he is saying appears to mean something different.

Well of course there is in caucus an opportunity for everyone to express his opinion honestly, and as you know there are some issues which are left to the individual member, like issues on licensing and sometimes on gambling and matters of that kind, where moral considerations come in. There are quite different attitudes that are adopted by different members. Sometimes the differences are not so much differences of principle as differences of method and of timing, and it's these which are discussed fully in caucus, and I must say that in caucus there is a much freer discussion of the merits of a case than there is when the matter comes before the House when the Party line is determined.

No, I, there's never been pressure to, in the normal sense of that term. There has generally been a consensus arrived at, and that consensus expresses itself in the House.

That right. And I think what the public want to know is the open discussion and the, and they would be much more interested if that could be heard in public. I don't think you could have you could possibly have the press present in caucus, although one sometimes wonders if they're not there. But the plain fact is that people must just assume certain things have happened in caucus, they might wish that the discussion that had taken place had, did take place in fact in Parliament itself.

Yes, well now you raise an interesting point here. I have felt for some time that we need more committee work, and incidentally, I think that in recent years we are seeing Parliament at its best, in the parliamentary select committees. Some members do most valuable work there, and the interesting thing is that in a committee, a member expresses his honest viewpoint, he tries to look at the evidence and, and to come to a conclusion on the facts as he sees them, and the Party viewpoint is subordinated to that. Now, if the press were present, I have a suspicion that members might not be so willing as they are at the present time, to express their honest viewpoint and to differ from the Party line, particularly as in New Zealand and I suppose in most countries, somebody who differs from the party is regarded as siding with the opposition, and selling out, and being a traitor and so on. Well there are some member who mightn't be disposed to take that risk.

Not necessarily.

Yes, I think that, I think when you come to the negotiation, to the discussion and the final decision, that obviously must be a matter where members sit round the table and discuss matters frankly and where the press could not possibly be present.

I don't think some members take full advantage of the opportunities that are offered to them to make a contribution to the House. I think there are some who perhaps speak too much, there are some who don't speak enough, and possibly it's true also to say that some of them don't study enough the subject upon which they intend to speak. Parliament nowadays being broadcast, it's particularly important that members should be well informed. They're not always well informed, not as well informed as they might be.

Yes, I think as a matter of fact that the New Zealand member is badly treated as far as secretarial and other assistance is concerned. This differs immensely from the rank and file member in other countries, and particularly does apply to the United States. Incidentally, I have noted a suggestion, I think I mentioned this, and you may have intended to question me on it, it's the question of whether the Party, particularly the Opposition party, shouldn't be given more information, more real information, more up to date information than is available to it at the present time. We were told at the recent Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference by the Canadian delegates, that they had taken steps in Canada to keep the Opposition properly informed, and to give it as much information as could possibly be given to it, other than ultra secret information, and so that when the matter came before the House for discussion, they would have the information at their fingertips and be just as well informed as Government happen to be on this particular subject.

Yes, well I find here a great difficulty in coming to a final conclusion. I have the feeling that the method that has been adopted in the Labour Party of having three people from the local Labour representation committee and three people from the national executive of the Party make the choice. I've had the feeling that that gives the impression to the people in the electorate that they, they have little say in the nominee selected. Now I know that feeling does exist, and I can't help believing that while the national executive of the Party, or the central executive or whatever it may be called, while that executive should have some say in vetoing somebody who is, or at least vetoing a decision who would give them somebody in Parliament who might not be up to it, I think that's something that should be exercised or a right that should be exercised only rarely, and that the individual electorate should be given a greater say, but perhaps the, with some guidance from the central committee as to the kind of candidate they want without saying that A is better than B.

Well the new method, of course, of determining the number of seats in the House will gradually lead us to a larger Parliament, and my own view is that a larger Parliament is desirable. The I think that nowadays people are mindful of the need, when they ask electing candidates, they're mindful of the need of selecting candidates who are likely to acquit themselves well in the House, who have the knowledge and experience that's necessary. We have of course a higher proportion of university graduates in the House nowadays than was the case, say twenty years ago, although I'm bound to say that some university graduates have disappointed me in the contributions which in fact they have made. And although some members of the House may not, to use a term you used earlier, be up to it, the plain fact is that their knowledge in their particular field, it may be a narrow field, may be of considerable values, and after all, Parliament is a representative institution.

Yes, yes, admittedly I am not sure that I would go with you that it ought to be as high as that at the present time, I think that somewhere around the hundred mark should be the limit, once we get to that mark we should cry halt. However that won't come for some years yet. The point that you raise here is very interesting, because one of the things that must puzzle a prime minister or the leader of a new party who hopes to become a prime minister, is where to find the material that he really wants for a cabinet adequate in size. Now after all, the present what, the present numbers of the present government party are forty four, they have, what is it, nineteen members of cabinet, and in addition to that they have to find two under secretaries, a speaker, a chairman of committees and so on, after all, with all possible respect to those who have been appointed, I think the Prime Minister may have been at a disadvantage in the selection that he had to make. And that would apply to any party where the proportion of members who are regarded as desirable in cabinet is so high as it is at the present time.

No, no I think we should reverse the process, we should reduce the size of Cabinet. I don't see the need for a cabinet of the size we have in New Zealand today.

Well I think that inevitably if you have men in cabinet positions who are incapable of grasping the full implications of their portfolio and of their department, that inevitably the public servant must play a larger part in making public policy. The ideal public servant will of course inform his minister of the facts, endeavour to persuade him in a certain direction, but make it very clear to him that it's his responsibility as Minister to make the decision. Otherwise you have that worst of all faults in a democracy, the bureaucratic rule.

I think that while some people believe that it would be possible for Parliament to pick its best men and say those men
Let me correct something here, you know. I think you probably got that from the New Zealand encyclopaedia, but it's wrong about the dates. I was born on the seventh of February 1901.

That's right, yes. Well first of all, as you say I was born in ?? My father had married my mother, who was a widow with three young children. I was the first child of the second marriage, and we lived in ?? for a couple of years, until I went, my parents went to Alexandra, in central ?? where I went through the primary school there.

Oh yes, very definitely.

Both, they were both religious, my mother particularly so. It was wrong to whistle on Sunday. It was wrong to dance. It was several things were wrong which I've accepted as quite proper today. It was very much of a puritan home, if I may put it that way.

Yes, yes it was, perhaps with some of the exceptions that occur in normal married lives. I was very much influenced by my mother, who was a lovely woman, and who was good in the very best sense of that term.

I have always been imbued with a desire to serve. This seemed to me the best way, at that time, of serving the community. I felt that here was an opportunity to serve, and I accepted the ordination as a Presbyterian minister, went to ?? in North Otago. That was, I was there for ten years before I resigned and stood for the ?? seat in Parliament.

Yes, without any reservations.

Well there were two things. First of all I felt that my ministry was not the success that I hoped it might have been. I suppose we all, in that position, have our disappointments, as I had mine, but what motivated me most was the fact that during the later part of my ministry there was established in my parish, a new hydro electric scheme known as ?? hydro. Men came there from all over New Zealand, and the conditions under which they worked, the conditions under which they arrived were appalling. This, I think, was the factor which influenced me most in deciding to or at least agreeing to stand for the ?? seat at the 1935 election. At that election I was, contrary to many expectations, elected, and I retained that seat for some fourteen years. Some people regarded it as a miracle that I won it, I regard it as a miracle that I held it for fourteen years.

Oh you may, you have, it's been called worse than that I tell you. I don't regard it as a black budget at all, and in the light of some budgets recently presented, my budget was very mild. If at that time men had been asked to pay for their beer as much as they are paying today, I think there would have been a revolution in the country.

Well I think the greatest controversy was caused over the over the increase in beer prices, and in cigarettes and tobacco. There were other features of the budget which some people didn't like, but there wasn't the same objection to them as there was to the raising of beer taxes. Now my own feeling was that at that time what I did was the proper course to take, and actually the later years I think vindicated my budget, because we got onto a very even keel in 1960, and unfortunately from that time we appear to have degenerated.

That's right, yes. Mr Nash as he then was, retired, and I became the leader, but I remained leader for only three years. Many of my party felt that the public would never forgive my black budget and that it would be unwise to retain me as leader. I think they were wrong, but still, that was over to them, and they decided by quite a substantial majority, that somebody else should be chosen in my stead.

That's right, yes.

Oh, fairly good. He wasn't an easy man to get along with. His procrastination was most frustrating on occasion, but he had a lot of likeable qualities too and we got along pretty well together. While I was Minister of Finance I enjoyed his confidence as the Prime Minister, and he stood by me all the way If some others in the party has been as, had been as loyal as he was, I think the result in 1960 might have been different.

Ooo it was a passion. As a matter of fact he had the acquisitive instinct, but it was wasn't confined so much to money as to paper, and he retained paper of very little value, and those who had to go through those papers have blessed him in the lack of wisdom he showed in selecting the papers that might be useful.

I suppose I did. It was a surprise to me quite frankly, for a number of reasons that I don't need to disclose, but I think they might have gone about it in a different way.

Well, it wasn't quite so being left without a week, I preferred to move quickly from my office, I didn't want to stay in the wings any longer, and as far as I was concerned I was prepared to retire gracefully, and I managed to clean up my office in a week and allow him therefore to come into office because it was thought by some in the party that all that was needed was a change of leadership and the party would immediately be returned to government. It didn't turn out that way.

He was a difficult man to assess, a man of moods. I don't want to be harsh in my criticism because it might be felt that because of my position I was biased. But being as objective as I can, I think Norman had some qualities that would have made him a great leader, but unfortunately there were deficiencies in his nature that showed up when he did become leader and particularly when he became Prime Minister.

Oh very definitely. That was more evident to others in the party than to me, but it was very evident when he became Prime Minister, that that was one of his troubles. And there were fields in which he was not outstandingly proficient, and I'm thinking particularly of finance and economics. He would have been much wiser to leave that to others and to concentrate on those fields where he was proficient.

That's possible. I've never known that on occasions just what it was that made me so unpopular, if that was one of the things I can understand it. They would of course have other reasons they would term them why I was unpopular, but if they counted that as one, who am I to complain.

I personally think that. It's regarded as part of the game, and ministers and members are expected to socialise, as you term it. My own feeling is that too much time is wasted on that, and that ministers would be much wiser to concentrate on their main job.

I am, I have just finished a task which was imposed upon me by the compensation, the Accident Compensation Commission, of investigating the freezing works and the un, what was regarded as the undue incidence of accident claims in that industry. I have finished with that now, and the, I am a government appointee on what is known as Offshore Mining Company Limited, which is the half part, the government's half of Maori Development Limited. I'm also a director of the Reserve Bank, and I am a director of an investment, at least a superannuation investment company.

Yes, justifiably so I think. And although, as I expected there have been loud noises from certain quarters, I think most medical men know what's been going on. They are as concerned about it as I have been and as the commission is, and I think they will take steps to deal with the matter because unfortunately, these few doctors who are not playing the game are bringing the profession into disrepute.

As such yes. If you mean am I in favour of everything in the act, then I would have to say no, I think that there are some things in it which may have been a mistake. But nevertheless the general principle of the act I agree with.

Yes, yes I think there is no doubt about that. Let me make it clear that I don't think they're confined to the freezing industry, although there are too many in the freezing industry who are bringing disrepute to the scheme. And my concern is that the whole act may have to be amended unless these people are disciplined.

Well I don't have many hobbies, as you say. I used to do a lot of fishing, trout fishing. I don't do very much of that now, and my hobbies are pretty limited. When I grow old I shall probably take up bowls, but only when I grow old.

I, I do. I'm told that I look much younger than my years, so that's not for me to say. But I think I am fairly well preserved and that there's still quite a lot of activity, mental activity in particular which I can indulge.

Yes, yes, yes, I attend the Presbyterian Church in Island Bay, here in Wellington, and I am an active elder in the Church. So I participate fully in religious life.

Well I would hardly put it that way, but at the same time I have never lost my religious faith. Although I went from religion to politics, that didn't mean that I abandoned religion. Indeed, I think that there is greater scope for religious and moral and ethical activity in politics than I found in the Church. I've never regretted the step that I took. There have been disappointments in political life, naturally one must expect that, but at the same time I think the step that I took in 1935 in standing for Parliament was the right one.

That's exactly right. I've had a fairly long political and semi-political career, and because I didn't expect gratitude, occasionally I got it, but I didn't expect it and I was surprised when I did get it.

Well I don't think there's any harm in expecting it.

Are you really wanting to know my view of the present situation?

Ooo I couldn't say that we can't afford, there are one or two things that I think we might legitimately cut back on, but the basic things in social welfare I'm still thoroughly in favour of and I think we can afford.

Ah, well.

Yes I know it's enormous, but the plain fact is that the government in its wisdom or otherwise, has decided on a universal superannuation. That's one of the things that people today criticise and say 'why are you giving it to people who don't need it and in many cases don't deserve it?’. Now the real question there in my view is the difference between age sixty, and, say a later age, be it sixty-five or even seventy. I think perhaps New Zealand made a mistake in making universal superannuation at age sixty. Being well over that age now, I can say I think perhaps it might have been wiser to start at a later age.

One of the troubles

No, no admittedly it wouldn't be known as a tax, but you'd still be paying, assuming the same amount would be paid out by the private insurance company as it's paid out by the state, it would require at least as much as the state requires, only the state taxes whereas the other individual sends you a bill every six months or yearly or whatever it may be.

I think they may not be as enthusiastic, because the it has at least dawned upon many of them that they have to pay for it. It was alright while the other fellow paid, but when everybody is expected to pay more or less towards this scheme, there's not the same enthusiasm for it, I admit.

Well I think they largely do that because there are benefits that are available to them, from, through the society that are not available to others. And consequently they are prepared to pay. Now admittedly, there is a very wide sphere of social service in the health field, but unfortunately the medical profession were not as cooperative as I personally would have liked when we introduced the scheme, and people today will not receive as much as, in the way of benefits as they might have received if there had been more cooperation.

Well, I know that the whole situation has changed, when today the very few doctors will visit the homes even when there is a real need. There are still some of the medical men who feel that their duty to visit the patient at home, although admittedly they are fewer and fewer as years go by.

I don't think so, I don't think it's a result of it. I think it's a recognition on the part of the profession that the twenty-four hour day, seven day service that people expected of a doctor was entirely unreasonable. It was. And some people were over-exacting in expecting the doctor to run after them and to attend them, when it was just as easy for them to go to the surgery.

There will always be a section of the community that feels that they need medical care when they don't. I think that applies today just as much as it did twenty or thirty years ago. But the fact remains, when people think that they need attention by a doctor, they're ill. They may not, may not be ill from the doctor's point of view, but they do require attention, even if it's only a placebo.

It was then. Not as bad as it is today

Well 1935 you had such terrific unemployment. It was, it was far worse than it is today. And the there was little done for the unemployed. They were left to their own resources, and in many cases their resources were very slender. One of the things that induced me to come into politics was just that, there was something radically wrong with society that allowed that state of affairs.

Oh undoubtedly. And it was not only worse, but there was far less done for the unemployed than is done today.

Well those are the, the, the wealth is produced by labour, by capital, by a combination of the two, and the, I'm sure there is enough wealth in New Zealand to ensure that the, the social services that we have been proud of in this country are continued. I don't say that the resources are indefinite, and that it doesn't matter what you add to what is already there, you can still pay for it, I think there must come a limit and I believe that already there are some things that we could cut back on that are not as necessary today as they might have been say thirty or forty years ago.

No, well anything that would give comfort to Mr Muldoon I would beg to be excused from.

What is called National Superannuation. There is perhaps room there for what is know as a 'cut', what is called a 'cut', simply by ensuring that those who don't need it are not paid it. Now I know there are different points of view on this business of whether you should pay some people whether they need it or not, and I know that a number of people, including the present government believe that it's good, that everybody should receive this amount, notwithstanding the fact that many of them don't deserve it, or need it. I believe that there is, there could be something done about reducing the burden on the rest of the community that this entails.

Well it depends on what your definition of 'afford' is. It's I know that there are some people who are burdened, if that's the right word, with a big family, and yet

Well I haven't heard that term used ironically, but the, the plain fact is that without some form of family benefit, there are some people in the community today who simply couldn't exist.

Ooo I don't regard it as plunder, I think that taxation is a legitimate form of extraction, that the state exercises from time to time for purposes that some people regard as extravagant, but which others would regard as needful.

Now that's a difficult one, 'on as we are now'. Do you mean that we keep it at the present level?

I don't see anything wrong with the philosophy, and I believe that there are still things that could be done by the state. But at the same time, I've already recognised that the, there is room for improvement in some respects, and that it might be a good idea to look more carefully at the largesse that is distributed in some quarters.

I don't blame them.

Well I don't like saying that it's so much better than anybody now. What I do say is that some of the, of the speakers that I served under were outstanding in my view as speakers. For example Mr Barnard, who was member for ?? was the first speaker that I worked under, he was very good. Sir Matthew was very good, Sir Ronald wasn't so bad, but he suffered from his eyesight, he couldn't read unless the type had been enlarged for him, and consequently he was very slow sometimes, in picking up. One of the problems that I see as far as speakers go is that it's so necessary to act quickly, to quell what could be a disorderly scene. And it's necessary for the speaker to be firm and particularly, even if he does seem to be abrupt, to nip in the bud, as it were, impending trouble.

There was a certain amount of it, I get the impression there's more of it today, there are more people who want to appear smart. But I don't think that we descended to the noisy scenes that one hears nowadays. I do wish that more of the members in Parliament would listen, go out and listen to what goes on in the House and form their own opinion of what happens there.

Yes, well that could well be, but I think one of the problems lies in the fact that people who speak in the House should be concerned with issues, not with persons, and so long as they address themselves to issues, they're effective. So long as they descend to personalities, they're less effective. I would hope that issues would remain the important thing, rather than persons.

No, I still think Parliament and our democratic system is the best system that operates, but some of the

trouble, they're all over, and all we can say, all of us, is that thank God that we're all safe.

OK, our first competitor is... May Forrester, I can't even read her name so Harry is screaming it out for us. May Forrester, come up and tell us about, you were born and bred and did everything on Stewart Island.

How long have you been here? Oh, what a question, no, we'll leave that one. But you, tell me, is there a hospital on Stewart Island? 

Well now, what happens when somebody has a baby on Stewart Island? Is there a district nurse, or a midwife?


And some of them go across to ?? I presume, the rather ?? ones go to ??. You're really tough Stewart Islanders.

Um, what, what does your husband do on Stewart Island?

In the fish, fishing boats?

Oh the sheds. 

Do you know, as we were flying over today from ??, we went right over the ??. that's where the oysters are right down there, and you know what I thought? When I sit back in Wellington and we pay thirty cents a dozen for oysters, and I think of the trouble and travail there's quite a strong southerly blowing out there today, and I thought of these fishermen going out there in the wintertime, and we guzzle up four or five dozen oysters and don't think about these blokes. Well I thought of them coming over today. Thanks very much, oyster fleet. I'm only sad that we're not here in the oyster season. Now Mrs Forrester, Christian name again?

May.  What's the name of the proprietess here at the New ?? Hotel?

Well I'd like to thank Mr and Mrs Hobday, they've looked after us with clothing, but unfortunately, everybody who lives on Stewart Island's a dwarf, and they have no clothing to fit me. And I'm doing this performance with a rug wrapped around me, one of Mrs, she gave us coffee and looked after us, and they said the bar will be open after eleven o'clock, of course there are licensing laws, we couldn't go and have even a quick snort. But the blokes at the fishing boats, they had a little bit there.  Um, that's your first question. No, the other explanation, all you people who sent your cards to enter for this competition, they're still lying at the foot of Half Moon Bay. But we've been in touch with them for cargo, there are some there that we can pick up on the way back to ?? tomorrow, so just, if you have written in, write in again to ?? Box 98 Wellington, put your name and address on one side, and your telephone number, and please not letters, because they're difficult to open. If you haven't got a card just address an envelope, stick it down, and put your name and address on the back and we'll draw you out. Now, the people that we would have drawn out today - Oh, there's a boat, is there someone out there trying to get it? No, they can't, I don't think they'll get it in time, because the aircraft's still lying on its back out there - but we will draw more names out of the hat, so you listen at home, you're not going to miss out, we'll draw them out at the ?? show tomorrow and match you up with the people. So Mrs Forrester, you'll be working, you and somebody else. The second question is: what, roughly, is the population of Stewart Island?

That's jolly good. Three hundred and fifty there are. Third question: after whom is Stewart Island named?

And who was Captain Stewart?

What do you mean he was the second one? Only one person can discover anything?

Did he? He didn't even have those oysters?

How many questions have you answered, Mrs Forrester?

You're so right, you win your prize. Harry, what is the prize? Hang on, let's see what your prize is, because there's some listener we're going to select at ?? tomorrow, and we'll know what prize they've got. Don't ask me to read it, I can't see a thing. And we usually select our competitors from beauty.

How about that. ??

Now what do you want. Do you want interior or exterior?

Outside, well that's better to breathe I think, isn't it? Are you going to paint the outside of your house? What colour would you like?

Green and white. We'll arrange for somebody, is there a ?? paint dealer over here on Stewart Island?

Well jolly good, arrange with him and you can go along and help yourself ??.

Well he'll probably want it for the boat. But that's jolly good, Berger paint for the boat, value of fifty dollars. The other prizes are the ?? watch. Now the ?? Swiss watch is there, we didn't have it with us, they sent a sample down for us, fortunately we left it, didn't we, but it's waterproof anyhow, so it wouldn't have come to any harm. We've got the NAC trip between any two New Zealand airports for one, there's the Massport motor mower, that's the premier two motor mower that makes your lawn seem twenty-five percent smaller. Actually, there's a much easier way. I know that the Massport people are very busy, they won't be listening, but the days of motor mowers are gone. All you've got to do is to come down to the ??, get all their slops of beer, you know, when they fill them, they, it spills over, you sprinkle this on your lawn, and you get the dregs from the whiskey and gin bottles, you sprinkle this on the lawn, and your lawns come up half cut. But the Massport is there, there's the ?? tour from Auckland to Wellington, and you connect by NAC, and a big prize for the big final, and  you never know who might be drawn out to enter in the big final is the ?? ?? sixteen inch transistor television set, and also the ?? tour, an eleven day tour from Christchurch to Christchurch all around the south islands for two, and again, NAC will connect. Oh the Ultimate iron of course, that might be in one of the prizes. Who's our second competitor?

Barbara Pointon. Now Barbara, you're a stranger, aren't you?

Where are you from?

I don't think there'd be any Maori MPs listening, so you go right ahead.

What were you doing in South Africa? What sort of job were you doing?

And are you retired now, or are you going to have an electrical business here?

Boy, there's tons of water to fish in, and there's beautiful fish, the Stewart Island, fish is magnificent. Have you been here in our oyster season?

Well you'll have something to look forward to. What about crayfish, do they get those nice big fat juicy crayfish?

Yesterday, it's all ??. Weather was so light you should have been here Thursday. Wednesday we should have been here. Anybody got any crayfish in the pot at home so we can nibble it on the aircraft going back? Huh? No, bad luck. Ah, questions about South Africa. What place in South Africa reminds you of a piece of furniture?

Yes, there's a place in South Africa reminds you of a piece of furniture.

Table Mountain. What a difficult question. The second question has to do with the North of England. The North of England. Well think of a question from the north of England. Name, I'll tell you what, name three soccer teams that have come from the North of England.

Newcastle United, yes.

?? yes.

?? Liverpool.

Oh that's marvellous, yes good question. Give her a nice hand for that. Your third question is: the Mersey tunnel runs under what river?

How clever you are. Three questions. Somebody, somebody who's fate will be decided tomorrow in ??, because we haven't got our things here at Stewart Island, somebody who's fate will be decided tomorrow will be going for the same prize with you. Harry, that ball point pen at Harry's writes under water. Marvellous. I've often wondered, let's see, just put your hand in there and pick out something interesting. Could be the Massport motor mower, could be that Ultimate steam and dry iron, could be that trip by ANC.

Steam and dry iron.

That's fabulous, as you wouldn't have brought an iron out with you?

Hasn't brought an iron out, her husband's an electrical contractor, they always say that the cobbler's children are the worst shod.

Well thank you very much. Indeed I'd forgotten your name already. Our next competitor, Harry?

Gwen Lewis. Harry's on the air, so Mrs Hall is alright you see, he's still got his voice. Gwen, how long have you been at Stewart Island.

Just over - where did you come from originally?

Hawk's Bay to Stewart Island? There must be a story behind this.

When did this happen?

What was your maiden name in Hawk's Bay?

Oh yes, yes ??

Then your husband, is he down here or did you meet him in Hawk's Bay? Where did you meet him?

You met at Stewart Island, you came back to his loving arms. What does he do on Stewart Island?

What was your maiden name in Hawk's Bay, so that our listeners up there can say that

Lewis. Your Christian name then is?

Gwendolyn. It's Gwen Lewis from Hawk's Bay, here she is trying to, you don't know any questions, you don't know any answers about Stewart Island?

Well let's start in the North Island then. What is the road between Napier and ?? called?

Napier ?? Highway, that's very very good indeed. The most prominent feature in Napier is called what?

Geographical, yes.

The Bluff Hill is ?? right. There are two, there are two marine lands in New Zealand, where are they?

One is in Napier, correct. Where is the second one?

No, no I don't think that, by golly, I might have found out this morning if it is in Heaven, you know. I'm assuming, of course.

You can ask me a question.

The other one's in the North Island, correct. And it's north of Napier and it, whoops, I'm losing the, losing the blanket.

Not Auckland, have another crack at it. A little south of Auckland, on the coast, because it's a marine land.

?? look at that for an answer. What ??, what ??. When, just remember Harry's soggy coat. I'm so glad, you wool growers I wore my woollen suit over, and a woollen jersey. I must apologise to you people that the sitting room here at the ?? hotel looks like a Chinese laundry, but we're trying to dry out, because I just can't imagine what the NAC passengers are going to say when we arrive at, back in ?? wrapped in a rug. What's the prize?

An Ultimate steam and dry iron, are we having a picnic down here, you'll all be ironing. That's marvellous. Thank you very much indeed. Harry have a look at your watch and tell us what the time is, would you?

Fifteen minutes gone, fifteen minutes gone.

It's ten minutes to twelve, how about that. Who's our next competitor now? Tell us more about Stewart Island. Come right up here and tell us your name in a loud, clear voice.

Maureen Jones, how long have you been at Stewart Island?

Well how long? All your life too?

Were you born here?

Where were you born?

You're another of these southerners. You sure get around.

How far north of ?? have you been in your lifetime?

As far as the Chateau. That's not bad, you left the northern part of the North Island out. They don't come down here, so why should you go up there.

Let me tell you people about Stewart Island. A wonderful place for a holiday. As we came in before, we came in and intended to land, we did have a flip around. There are some gorgeous bays over here, absolutely heavenly. At the, of course you can come across here in a couple of hours by boat, you can come across in the amphibian. Wonderful place for a holiday. There's the hotel here, there's a guesthouse, there are a lot of cribs that are available aren't they Mrs Hobday, for rent at holiday times?

Oh what's wrong? Is that your little monster? Well go you go and nurse her then, she'll feel happier. You go and put her in your arms. I want to talk about Firestone country, yesterday we left ?? in the morning and it was snowing, believe it or not, and was I glad that we had Firestone F7 tires on our car, because it can be a bit treacherous driving in snow. Now with Firestone F7 you are sure that you're travelling safely, and remember, it's the holiday weekend coming up, so make sure that you've got good tyres on your car, particularly if you’re going through some of the rougher country that we've been through recently, not that the road from ??'s rough, it's a magnificent highway, but we were a little concerned, we've got a very heavily laden station wagon, and it's pretty hard work on the tyres. But with Firestone F7, you're sure that you've got good grip in snow, rain, wind, it doesn't matter, those Firestones will stick you to the road. And that's where it's important in cars, where the tyres meet the road is the important thing. You fit Firestone F7. Shall we talk about the Pye television set now? I think we'd better, the Pye sixteen.

Now there's a thing they say at the end, that the name doesn't go on until the quality's proved, with the Pye television set. Do you have television over here on Stewart Island? If you're going to replace your set get a Pye. They go from the sixteen inch transistor portable right up to the twenty-five inch luxury set in the Pye television range. If you want radio, if you want television, Pye. P-Y-E, that's the name to remember. Now, stand up, oh you've got your little girl there, that's fine. Little girl or little boy?

Is that pink or blue? I can't see.

Oh that's good. What's his name?

Megan, I'm sorry. Megan. That's your first question answered. How old is Megan?

One what?

Oh, jolly good. Has she got any brothers or sisters?

One brother, one sister? Isn't that marvellous. You're really, this is how you're going to plan your family, one boy one girl, one boy one girl?

Now you said this, what did you do when you went up to the Chateau, as a matter of interest?

You went skiing. You passed Coronet Peak to go to the Chateau? And do you prefer skiing at Coronet Peak or at the Chateau, just tell me?

That's what I say is the laziest skiing I've ever heard, 'I just stand on the sideline and watch'. How are we going for time, Harry? Tell the customers what the time is.

Six minutes to twelve. You've answered two questions. Here is your -

One? No, we asked her the name of the baby and her age. Two, yes let’s be really generous today, let’s, let’s show our gratitude in some tangible way. What does your husband do?

He's a - does anybody do anything on Stewart Island except fish? 

No, apart from that. 

We have carpenters, we have hoteliers, we have, how many retired people? Are there many retired people? This must be a wonderful place to retire to.

Oh, that's marvellous. But your husband's a fisherman?

What time does he go out? How do these fishermen work from here, do they go out all day or do they go out for a week at a time or?

Good morning to you, ??, and very happy birthday greetings to 1ZB. My association with 1ZB goes back even earlier that you mentioned in your preamble, it goes back to in fact 1937, when I was involved in the soap opera 'One Man's Family'.

That of course was a local production. It was the first local production of a soap opera. It had a fairly short life; I think it ran for about eighteen months. The scripts used to come out from America, they were adapted for the New Zealand scene, there was never, it was never set in any particular place. So the, my association goes back a very very long time in fact the thirty-nine of the forty years that 1ZB been on air, and it's been a very happy association. You mentioned 'It's in the Bag'. The very first production of 'It's in the Bag' was done in your radio theatre.

Round about 1954 I think it was.

Well in 1948, Ian ??, who was then director of programs of the old NZBF, the commercial programs, suggested I do a program call 'Poses, Penalties and Profits'. Now that was a nine week wonder. That was the first big giveaway program. We recorded it at eight o'clock and it went out on disk at nine o'clock. In fact while we were, while they were transmitting the first large disk, you remember the old thirty-three ?? disks, we were recording the second disk, and while that was going out we were recording the third disk. But that only ran for nine weeks. Don't ask me why it was ever taken off the air, because it had a terrific impact, in fact some of the small cinemas around the country, the country cinemas on Thursday nights, it was broadcast on Thursday nights, didn't bother to open the doors, because nobody was there. And up till then of course, it was a shilling and a free clean sort of quiz program. Well then John Maybury, Jack Maybury rather, Jack Maybury came into the scene, and he started with ?? Brothers about the same time, and he originated 'Luck’s/Lux Money go round', he originated 'Quiz Kids' and 'Challenge of the Cities' and other programs. Then of course he went over to Australia, and I took over his job in ??, who were the advertising agents for Levers, and I took over his program 'Luck’s Money go Round', 'Quiz Kids', which we used to do more in the Auckland 1ZB Radio Theatre than anywhere else in New Zealand, so it was virtually based on Auckland. Then my commitments became too heavy, and John Raynor?? took over 'Quiz Kids', and it was based permanently in Auckland from that moment on. Then I had to change, get a new program idea, and that's when 'It's in the Bag' came up, and that was around about 1954, and it ran, what eleven, twelve, thirteen years, and there's been a lag of nine years between that being on radio and coming onto television.

Not in the slightest. We were all, we had the same audience, the same audience would listened to his programs as listened to mine, and then of course ?? came in with later programs, and but we were, the audience was the same, it was not as it is with television now, where you are competing with one channel or one station against the other. The commercial stations had the audience, and that was it. ?? competition, and we were very great personal friends.

I wouldn't have a clue how many miles we travelled, but, but I have some very happy associations with the late Ted Thorpe, of course, who was travelled with me for years, Brian Petrie, who's now with ?? advertising. There's so many people that I have such happy memories of over these years of broadcasting and commercial broadcasting, and I personally think that commercial broadcasting is coming back.

I do. I think that the opportunity for radio, for night time radio, has never been better. I think that the standard, the general standard of television programs, that people are getting sick of blood and guts and violence and comp shows and what have you, and I think that radio has a great opportunity of coming back now and fighting against television.

The ‘Lever Head Parade’.

Well you people are still running a similar sort of program with ?? on Thursday nights I think, isn't it, that you have it on?

Radio New Zealand? And you know this program, when I see the ‘Diana Shaw Show’ I think of these days when we had Diana Shaw and Perry Como and

Rosemary Clunig, that’s great. Of course we, the pop stayed in very much longer in those days, they were at the top of the poll, for some of the times they'd go for ten or fifteen weeks.

As Mr Omo. I commuted over four years to do those commercials.

And in fact quite a number of Australians I've run into, we went for a cruise while we were doing these commercials and they said, you know they quite couldn't quite get that this New Zealander and ?? Australia, they must be very alike. Australians who remember it.

Well, it's a, it's a different aspect, ??. I was always confident that it would go well on television. I didn't think it would go as well as it has done. I think the secret of it is to play it thirteen weeks on and thirteen weeks off so that we always leave them wanting more. I wouldn't like to do it as we did it in the old days of radio, fifty-two weeks of the year, year in year out, because I think that people would tire of it more quickly on television that they would on radio, and I'm very happy there with the ratings at the moment, for some reason you good people in Auckland are letting me down, we're top rating in all centres except Auckland, In Auckland we're down about eight or tenth place, the last figures I saw. But I think that the reason for this is that Saturday night you're a more sophisticated people up there, you go out more, you've got more nightclubs, more cabarets to attract people away from television on Saturday nights, in fact now that, well I, that's the excuse I give them.

Well I don't know. We'll just keep going and as long as the public keep watching I guess. We've, I've got into a new field of course, with this 'Beauty and the Beast', the midday program which seems to have an appeal. We did a similar program, I didn't ever do it, John Raynor did it, called 'Leave it to the Girls', which was a very popular program on radio. 

And I would say that this is another opportunity for radio to come back with this sort of panel discussion. You know I really think that as far as radio's concerned and particularly the commercial radio, that you are confining yourselves too much to music. I think that people are interested, women in their homes or anybody in their homes on their own want company, and not so much the company of music, but the company of people talking and discussing problems. So there it is, if you're looking for a program idea, do a quality into the girls again on radio again.

Thank you very much ??

Goodbye everybody.




I was born Selwin Featherstone Twogood on the fourth of April 1916, at a lying in hospital at the Terrace, Wellington. The name Twogood I owe to my Scandinavian forebears. In its original form, Foregod, it commemorates the Viking god of war, and I'm sure every member of the Twogood family must have at some stage wished that our ancestors had had the good sense to stick with the original spelling. When you've lived with being called all the variations - nogood, twobig, neveranygood, all your life, you long for a simple name like, like Cholmondeley. The astonishing thing is that everybody who comes out with these witticisms believes he thought of them first. 

My Christian names, Selwyn Featherstone commemorate a bishop and a small country town respectively. The name Selwyn I owe to my maternal grandfather, George Herbert Butler. He was the epitome of the phrase 'an English gentleman', so much so that even now I haven't found out what he actually did for a living. I have a feeling he was a civil servant. I do know that he was a keen churchman and a lay reader at St Peter's Church, Willis St Wellington. And he felt it entirely fitting that his new grandson should bear the name of the good Bishop Selwyn, who was among the first to foster the growth of Christianity in New Zealand. Whether or not he had an ambition for me to take up the cloth we never discovered, although as my wife Cynthia is quick to point out, while I might have made an imposing figure as a bishop, I would surely have made a lousy curate.

How I came to be named after Featherstone, that pleasant little ?? upper township, standing in the shadow of the ?? range, takes a little longer to tell. We have to go back to my paternal grandparents. My grandfather, William Twogood, a Yorkshire mariner, decided to settle on the land. I've always believed him to have been a sea captain, but my brother Warren has recently taken up trying to convince me that he was in fact a mate. As he didn't distinguish himself in later life, I'm content to go on believing that he'd had his day of glory while at sea and retired a happy man. So I'll stick with my version of the story, thanks Warren. Captain Twogood then left the sea and brought his family out to New Zealand to settle. His wife died tragically in a house fire only a few years after they arrived, and my father really never knew her. I've always cited William as being a man of great foresight. In the first place, he swallowed the anchor because he could see no future in steamships, and in the second, he opened a drapery business in Featherstone. No sooner he had finished polishing the brand new till, and arranging the bolts of calico in the window, when at a smart clip arrived a horse and trap, bearing Alex Smith, son of James Smith, the large Wellington drapery importer. The trap was chock full of samples from the sophisticated city, which he'd painstakingly taken half a day to haul over the river ?? to peddle to the fashion starved settlers of the ??. The Featherstone ladies were drawn to Smith's trap like ants to honey, while Captain Twogood stood sadly by on the sidelines. It would be truthful to say that the ?? Trading Company, as he called his little business, failed to set the world on fire, but he was nevertheless very fond of the town of Featherstone and he named his next son, my father, Henry Featherstone Twogood after it. And my father, who recognised the beginnings of a family tradition when he saw one, responded by adding the name to the two I already had and thus I became Selwyn Featherstone Twogood before I had any say in the matter. Given the family propensity for naming the children after the location of the family business, I can only thank my lucky stars that William Twogood hadn't opened his little shop at ?? or Queen Charlotte ??
A favourite people, the shut ins. It was around Daisy that I learned very early in my career some important lessons for any commercial broadcaster.


Well this is my fifty-first year in radio in New Zealand. In 1934 I appeared in my first radio play, I had two words to say, it was '??', and for that I received the sum of ten and sixpence, but I had to wear a dinner jacket. It was a live radio play. In those days the radio plays relied on amateurs and generally amateur producers, there were no, there were no professional producers in the broadcasting area, they would get people from Wellington repertory and people like George Swan, for instance, would produce plays. And so that's how I came into broadcasting, through working in repertory and the Thespians as an amateur actor. That was the only pool that they had to draw on for radio drama. And then just prior to the war, when Professor Shelley, Sir James Shelley took over, he brought Bernard Beebey in, and the he was the first professional producer that they had. And even in those days, we produced the plays in off-office times, because people couldn't get away from their work, people solicitors, lawyers, were always very strong in the amateur drama. And then there were lots of other people too, and we used to work in the lunch hour, between one and two we'd record a slot of a play, then we'd come back between five and seven and do another one. That was immediately prior to the war. Then of course during the war, the radio drama section was used in the main, I think, for propaganda. But Bernard Beebey laid the foundation for New Zealand radio drama, the professional radio drama. I came back from the war on leave, and I ran into Bernard in Featherstone St, and he said 'Look, we're desperate for actors, would you come along', which I didn't take as much as a compliment, mind you. I was very happy to do it, because I came back on three months leave, and then that leave was extended for another two months, so I had five months before I went back to the middle east in 1945, to find, when I arrived there, the war was over. Then when I came back to New Zealand, the, what do they call them, the Labour, what is now Labour Department, they decided I should become a tram conductor. That didn't appeal to me very much, so I decided that radio was the only way I could make a living. I had been a theatre manager in Wellington for the ?? organisation, and I realised that Mr Kerridge?? wouldn't be terribly pleased with me to come back and manage the Majestic Theatre, all the old ?? blokes coming in and wanting free seats, so I decided to give away theatre management. That's how I came into, into radio, and of course, some weeks you'd earn twenty pounds, some weeks you'd earn thirty pounds, it was a very precarious existence, but I was the really the first professional actor who relied entirely on radio as, as a living. Then there were other programs of course, that came by the way, and then there were national film unit, national film unit commentaries. And that's how I came into broadcasting. And then when John Maybury left New Zealand to go to Australia he suggested to the advertising agency, to ?? that I should take over the programs that he was doing, and from then on of course it's, it's a pretty well known story, that I was involved with five or six, seven or eight programs in the radio days.

Never. Never have been, and I don't think I ever would

Well no, I don't think it was on purpose. I did a lot of contract work, I did a breakfast session at 2ZB on contract. But I knew that there was an undercurrent with the permanent staff members, they couldn't see why a contractor should be paid more than a permanent staff member, which of course the only reason was that we didn't, we had no superannuation, we had no definite tenure and it, it was a pretty you know, you didn't know where you were from week to week.

No I see it as, as, as acting. You act a part, you take on the role of a quizmaster, you take on the role of a continuity announcer, you take on the role of a musical introducer - I introduced 'The Lever Hit parade' for years. You assume that role as an actor, that wasn't me, and I think that if you go back over those programs you would see that there's a different personality came up, in 'the Lever Hit Parade' I had a different image, for instance, from 'It's in the Bag' or from 'Luck's Money go Round' or 'Bird's Eye View of the World'. It was a different person, you were playing a part. The nearest that that, the nearest that I've got to it is in 'Beauty and the Beast', of being myself on the media.

Well quiz programs of course, in those, in those days of radio and the days of peak radio, and I'm talking now of the fifties, the sixties and then the gradual decline, but the guts of commercial broadcasting in those days was the quiz program. There was the Jack Maybury programs, which were taken over after his death by John, then Sandy Triggs did some quiz programs for Nestles??, he was working with me for some time, and then he went over to Nestles and did radio programs for them. But you see we were doing, we were doing one two three four five, between us we were doing about seven quiz programs a week in peak time. And that was when the peak audience, that's what the audience wanted. And I can never understand why the quiz program hasn't assumed the same stature in television as it did on radio, I presume it was cost.  You see in America the quiz programs are all daytime. In Australia they're all daytime, except there was one program, 'Cole's Seven Thousand Dollar Quiz' or something. It was nighttime. But generally they went into game shows for television. But we'll come to that later.

Television came in at the time when broadcasting was changing its, its whole image, in that about the time that television started, it ceased to become a government department. Now on the thirty-first of March, I forget what year it was, anybody working for the, on the payroll of broadcasting was a civil servant. Now you can't on the first of April suddenly become not a civil servant, and over the years fortunately its the, natural attrition is having its part. But there were so many of the, civil service - I don't want to mention them by name, naturally - but there were so many who were civil service orientated, who couldn't see beyond the civil service rulebook. And this was one of the inhibiting things, as far as television was concerned, in those very early days. And of course the lack of money, you know, they started off on a shoestring. When you think of the appalling accommodation we had at ?? Street, the appalling accommodation they had in Christchurch and in Auckland. Auckland hasn't improved a great deal, incidentally. They're still working in the old, in the old ?? Street studios. And all makeshift. At least in Wellington we've got studios that were built as a television complex, whether you agree with how Avalon is operating or not is beside the point, but that, it's the only part of television that was built and designed to handle television, the rest of it's been makeshift from the very start, which is quite extraordinary that they've done so well.

Oh yes the people, the people that have come into it are now a different breed of people, the people in television, they're far more liberal in their ideas, their the producers have a little more independence I think than they had under the old days, you're going back into the days of when Terry Brian, for instance was under the restriction of, of having civil servants or ex civil servants on top of him, found it very limiting. But there were some marvellous people in those days who were producers. Malcolm Kent is an example. He was a cameraman in those early days in ?? Street, a boy in short pants virtually, now head of entertainment, and a man for whom I have the greatest admiration. But as far as the prod - Cam Sidell of course has gone out of it now, he's, he's in the, he's in the film unit. But Chris Bourne was one of the early producers and then was syphoned off and went into management, which was a pity I think, because Chris Bourne had a, had a great deal of talent as a producer and a director. And of course this is what people don't understand, that the difference between a producer and a director. The producer is the man who handles the purse strings, the director is the man who handles the cameras and decides what shots you're going to get, and he's a very important man. And he can ruin anybody's career. If anybody tries the heavy on a director, he's he's finished as far as television's concerned. This didn't apply in radio, but it certainly does in television. He can call those shots that can put you in the worst possible light. And I've always got on well with my producers and directors, and I'm very thankful for that.

No no no, not not in television.

No, no I do I do a lot, I've got a lot of confidence in really a Pacific particularly for the age group that my, the products I'm associated with, and I've had great success with Radio Pacific on their talk back programs, they've always been very generous with time, I can ring Derek Lowe any time and say 'look, I want to talk for an hour on the ?? time share apartments, and Derek will say 'it's yours'. Okay, they do some advertising as well, but we don't get this opportunity on radio New Zealand, and that audience, the audience that's listening to radio Pacific are the age group that I'm looking for.

Conductor, I wasn't good enough to be a driver.

No, no because, well, it it was a matter of earning the living the best way you could. See I'd been hopeless, I wasn't an academic, I'd had limited success as far as the army was concerned, I was in sort of a rut. I'd held the same job for four years in divisional headquarters as ammunition officer, so I, there was nothing else I could do. I didn't have any academic, I'd've liked to be a lawyer and I'm delighted that our son has done well in the profession, but I didn't have the brains to become a lawyer, a lot of people came back from the war at my age of thirty, whatever was it, thirty-one, thirty-two and went  to university, studied and became teachers, or lawyers or scientists. I didn't have that application, I didn't have the brains to do that.

It's it's knowledge that I've picked up. You see I'm a great, we're both Cynny and I are great crossword puzzlers and it's incredible how often, just out of the blue, the other day there was a clue and I wrote it down straight away, Martello tires/tiles??, and Cynny said 'I've never heard of the Martello Tiles, well I've obviously read it in getting, you see in all the quiz programs I've done the questions myself. So I've done a tremendous amount of encyclopaedia reading, picking up useless information, like, for instance, the Martello Tiles, that suddenly in a crossword puzzles it comes up and it's there. I don't have a good retention, I'm more of a practical person than, you know, getting, studying from books, I'm not, I was never very good at it.

Oh yes. 

Oh yes, oh yes. I I'd I have no doubt, I have no doubt that had I decided to go to Australia, that I could have done well in Australia. I had no desire to go to Australia to live, I, in the meantime when I came back from the war we married and we had a family. We had all sorts of ideas when we were first married, my wife being a registered nurse, that we'd go to England and I'd - I'd've liked to have become an actor in Britain, and again to be frank, I think I'd've done well. I did very well in amateur theatricals in New Zealand, there are still people who remember parts that I played. I think that I could've made it. For all the people who are unemployed in the theatre, I think I could've made it on the English stage. But I'm quite happy with I've spent my life in New Zealand. I vouch for if I had my time again I doubt if I'd change anything.

Oh no no.

No no no I just like our lifestyle, and every time I come back from overseas I think know lucky we are to live in this country. There's a lot that I don't like about it, but then wherever you live it's the same. No I'm very happy to be a New Zealander, and I'm very happy to be a big fish in a small pond.

That didn't appeal to me very much, so I decided that radio was the only way I could make a living. I had been a theatre manager in Wellington for the ?? organisation, and I realised that Mr Kerridge?? wouldn't be terribly pleased with me to come back and manage the Majestic Theatre, all the old ?? blokes coming in and wanting free seats, so I decided to give away theatre management. That's how I came into, into radio, and of course, some weeks you'd earn twenty pounds, some weeks you'd earn thirty pounds, it was a very precarious existence, but I was the really the first professional actor who relied entirely on radio as, as a living. Then there were other programs of course, that came by the way, and then there were national film unit, national film unit commentaries. And that's how I came into broadcasting. And then when John Maybury left New Zealand to go to Australia he suggested to the advertising agency, to ?? that I should take over the programs that he was doing, and from then on of course it's, it's a pretty well known story, that I was involved with five or six, seven or eight programs in the radio days.

Never. Never have been, and I don't think I ever would

Well no, I don't think it was on purpose. I did a lot of contract work, I did a breakfast session at 2ZB on contract. But I knew that there was an undercurrent with the permanent staff members, they couldn't see why a contractor should be paid more than a permanent staff member, which of course the only reason was that we didn't, we had no superannuation, we had no definite tenure and it, it was a pretty you know, you didn't know where you were from week to week.

No I see it as, as, as acting. You act a part, you take on the role of a quizmaster, you take on the role of a continuity announcer, you take on the role of a musical introducer - I introduced 'The Lever Hit parade' for years. You assume that role as an actor, that wasn't me, and I think that if you go back over those programs you would see that there's a different personality came up, in 'the Lever Hit Parade' I had a different image, for instance, from 'It's in the Bag' or from 'Luck's Money go Round' or 'Bird's Eye View of the World'. It was a different person, you were playing a part. The nearest that that, the nearest that I've got to it is in 'Beauty and the Beast', of being myself on the media.

Well quiz programs of course, in those, in those days of radio and the days of peak radio, and I'm talking now of the fifties, the sixties and then the gradual decline, but the guts of commercial broadcasting in those days was the quiz program. There was the Jack Maybury programs, which were taken over after his death by John, then Sandy Triggs did some quiz programs for Nestles??, he was working with me for some time, and then he went over to Nestles and did radio programs for them. But you see we were doing, we were doing one two three four five, between us we were doing about seven quiz programs a week in peak time. And that was when the peak audience, that's what the audience wanted. And I can never understand why the quiz program hasn't assumed the same stature in television as it did on radio, I presume it was cost.  You see in America the quiz programs are all daytime. In Australia they're all daytime, except there was one program, 'Cole's Seven Thousand Dollar Quiz' or something. It was nighttime. But generally they went into game shows for television. But we'll come to that later.

Television came in at the time when broadcasting was changing its, its whole image, in that about the time that television started, it ceased to become a government department. Now on the thirty-first of March, I forget what year it was, anybody working for the, on the payroll of broadcasting was a civil servant. Now you can't on the first of April suddenly become not a civil servant, and over the years fortunately its the, natural attrition is having its part. But there were so many of the, civil service - I don't want to mention them by name, naturally - but there were so many who were civil service orientated, who couldn't see beyond the civil service rulebook. And this was one of the inhibiting things, as far as television was concerned, in those very early days. And of course the lack of money, you know, they started off on a shoestring. When you think of the appalling accommodation we had at ?? Street, the appalling accommodation they had in Christchurch and in Auckland. Auckland hasn't improved a great deal, incidentally. They're still working in the old, in the old ?? Street studios. And all makeshift. At least in Wellington we've got studios that were built as a television complex, whether you agree with how Avalon is operating or not is beside the point, but that, it's the only part of television that was built and designed to handle television, the rest of it's been makeshift from the very start, which is quite extraordinary that they've done so well.

Oh yes the people, the people that have come into it are now a different breed of people, the people in television, they're far more liberal in their ideas, their the producers have a little more independence I think than they had under the old days, you're going back into the days of when Terry Brian, for instance was under the restriction of, of having civil servants or ex civil servants on top of him, found it very limiting. But there were some marvellous people in those days who were producers. Malcolm Kent is an example. He was a cameraman in those early days in ?? Street, a boy in short pants virtually, now head of entertainment, and a man for whom I have the greatest admiration. But as far as the prod - Cam Sidell of course has gone out of it now, he's, he's in the, he's in the film unit. But Chris Bourne was one of the early producers and then was syphoned off and went into management, which was a pity I think, because Chris Bourne had a, had a great deal of talent as a producer and a director. And of course this is what people don't understand, that the difference between a producer and a director. The producer is the man who handles the purse strings, the director is the man who handles the cameras and decides what shots you're going to get, and he's a very important man. And he can ruin anybody's career. If anybody tries the heavy on a director, he's he's finished as far as television's concerned. This didn't apply in radio, but it certainly does in television. He can call those shots that can put you in the worst possible light. And I've always got on well with my producers and directors, and I'm very thankful for that.

No no no, not not in television.

No, no I do I do a lot, I've got a lot of confidence in really a Pacific particularly for the age group that my, the products I'm associated with, and I've had great success with Radio Pacific on their talk back programs, they've always been very generous with time, I can ring Derek Lowe any time and say 'look, I want to talk for an hour on the ?? time share apartments, and Derek will say 'it's yours'. Okay, they do some advertising as well, but we don't get this opportunity on radio New Zealand, and that audience, the audience that's listening to radio Pacific are the age group that I'm looking for.

Conductor, I wasn't good enough to be a driver.

No, no because, well, it it was a matter of earning the living the best way you could. See I'd been hopeless, I wasn't an academic, I'd had limited success as far as the army was concerned, I was in sort of a rut. I'd held the same job for four years in divisional headquarters as ammunition officer, so I, there was nothing else I could do. I didn't have any academic, I'd've liked to be a lawyer and I'm delighted that our son has done well in the profession, but I didn't have the brains to become a lawyer, a lot of people came back from the war at my age of thirty, whatever was it, thirty-one, thirty-two and went  to university, studied and became teachers, or lawyers or scientists. I didn't have that application, I didn't have the brains to do that.

It's it's knowledge that I've picked up. You see I'm a great, we're both Cynny and I are great crossword puzzlers and it's incredible how often, just out of the blue, the other day there was a clue and I wrote it down straight away, Martello tires/tiles??, and Cynny said 'I've never heard of the Martello Tiles, well I've obviously read it in getting, you see in all the quiz programs I've done the questions myself. So I've done a tremendous amount of encyclopaedia reading, picking up useless information, like, for instance, the Martello Tiles, that suddenly in a crossword puzzles it comes up and it's there. I don't have a good retention, I'm more of a practical person than, you know, getting, studying from books, I'm not, I was never very good at it.

Oh yes. 

Oh yes, oh yes. I I'd I have no doubt, I have no doubt that had I decided to go to Australia, that I could have done well in Australia. I had no desire to go to Australia to live, I, in the meantime when I came back from the war we married and we had a family. We had all sorts of ideas when we were first married, my wife being a registered nurse, that we'd go to England and I'd - I'd've liked to have become an actor in Britain, and again to be frank, I think I'd've done well. I did very well in amateur theatricals in New Zealand, there are still people who remember parts that I played. I think that I could've made it. For all the people who are unemployed in the theatre, I think I could've made it on the English stage. But I'm quite happy with I've spent my life in New Zealand. I vouch for if I had my time again I doubt if I'd change anything.

Oh no no.

No no no I just like our lifestyle, and every time I come back from overseas I think know lucky we are to live in this country. There's a lot that I don't like about it, but then wherever you live it's the same. No I'm very happy to be a New Zealander, and I'm very happy to be a big fish in a small pond.
