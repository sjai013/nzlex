Hello boys and girls. The last time I spoke on this session I was here with George Lowe, who I'm sure you'll all remember, and we were talking about the climb of Mount Everest. This time, both George Lowe and myself are rather turning our thoughts in another direction; we're both planning to go down to the Antarctic. As you probably all know, the Antarctic lies almost due south of New Zealand here, and in fact New Zealand is one of the countries which is closest to the Antarctic of any land. In our day, in science magazines and in comics, there's a lot of talk about trips to Mars, and we're always seeing pictures of space men with glass bowls on their head. Well a trip into the Antarctic is just as much of a journey into the unknown. It's not a journey through millions of miles of space, but sort of backwards through millions of years of time, into the Ice Age. Because down in the Antarctic, there's an enormous continent that's bigger than the whole of the United States. But most of it is covered with snow and ice, and some of the snow and ice is thousands of feet thick. However, it's not by any means all covered with snow and ice, and in places there are large mountain ranges, pushing their way up through the ice, and there it is possible to see just exactly what the rock is like, to examine it, and see if there's anything really worthwhile there in the form of minerals. 

Now when you go down to the Antarctic, you can expect all sorts of weird circumstances. For instance, in the Antarctic Summer, there is no night at all. There's daylight all the time, so when you want to go to bed, you just set your clock and decide you're going to go to bed at ten o’clock, and even though it's still bright and daylight all around, you go to bed and have your sleep. In the same way, during the Antarctic Winter, there's no daylight at all, and for about three long months, you don't see the sun, and it's just dark. Now this seems to be the most difficult time of all for men down there, because it's very difficult for them to move around, extremely cold, and so they are confined most of the time to their huts. And during this time they have to keep busy, otherwise they all might get rather worried, and fret a lot, and be no use at all in the summer.

Now the reason that we are going down on a New Zealand expedition, I think we really have three main reasons. First of all, there is the fact that we have been given a very important job to assist the British trans-Antarctic expedition. Now this is an expedition that's crossing from one side of the Antarctic continent to the other. It's a trip of nearly two thousand miles over snow and ice, and it includes going through the South Pole. Well this has never been done before, although many men have dreamt about it and planned to do it in the past fifty years. 

The best-known man of these was the famous explorer Shackleton. In 1914, he made a plan up to go from one side to thee other of the Antarctic continent and he set off in one ship to one side of the continent, and he sent another ship to the other side. Well unfortunately his own ship, down in the Weddell Sea, it was caught in the ice, frozen in, and then some wind started blowing and the ice was all tossed around and resulted in the ship being completely crushed, and it sank. Oh but Shackleton was a remarkable leader, and he got all his men safely out onto the ice, and they sailed on some ice flows?? for many months, until finally they reached the open sea, and he was able to launch the small boats they had with them, and they got in these and sailed across the very stormy oceans indeed to finally reach safety. But of course this meant that they hadn't been successful in crossing the continent. Well in the next few years the, his plan is going to be attempted again, this time by a British expedition. A party from the United Kingdom is going down to ?? bay, which is really south of South Africa, and down there they are going to establish a base, and then from that base, using vehicles, ?? vehicles, specially made for crossing snow and ice, they're going to attempt to go over that two thousand mile trip, to the South Pole, to the opposite side of the continent. Included in that crossing party is our own New Zealander, George Lowe. And he's going along, because of course he's a very experienced man with snow and ice in the Himalayas, but also because he's an expert for movie photographer, and he'll be taking a record of the trip all the way through.

Now from New Zealand, we have a very useful job to do in respect to the trans-Antarctic expedition, because we've been given the job of support, from the New Zealand end. South of us, south of New Zealand, there is the Ross Sea dependency which we claim as belonging to New Zealand, and we are going down in that dependency to establish a base at a place called ??. Down here we'll build this base, and from it we'll start trips out onto the Polar plateau, making dumps of food and fuel out towards the South Pole. The idea is that when the trans Antarctic expedition crosses through the south pole, and starts heading towards ??, it will be extremely short on food and fuel, by that time, no doubt, all the men will be rather tired and done in, and our job is to go out and meet them as far out as we can, to give them food and fuel and to help them back over the last hundreds of miles of difficult going, down to ??. And then the whole lot of us will return back to New Zealand. 

We regard this as a very important job, because we know that in as much as we have to ?? these dumps to food and fuel, well the lives of the trans Antarctic expedition will depend upon us doing the job well. If they cross through the pole and don't manage to find the food and fuel, well they might never reach back to civilisation again. However we're going down for other reasons too. We claim this area in the Antarctic, and we feel now that it's going to be necessary to explore it, to map it, and to examine all the rocks and so on, just to find out exactly what there is down there. This is going to be a very long job because there's a mountain range in the Ross dependency which is a thousand miles long, which is as long as the, from one end to the other of New Zealand, and it won't be possible for us of course to examine every part of this just in one year, but we do hope to examine quite a lot of it, to explore some of the valleys, to climb up the glaciers and make quite a good map anyway, of the area through which we're going. 

Now we intend to use down there a combination of methods of travelling around. You know in the old days of Scott, and Shackleton and Amundsen, when they were making their attempts to get to the South Pole, well they used as a method of transport either ponies, mules or dogs. Well Amundsen who finally reached the Pole first, he used dogs, and it was found that that was a much more, much easier form of transport, and a much more efficient one. Well even nowadays, some forty years after, dogs and dog teams, are regarded as the most efficient form of transport over very rough ground. If you can get easy and flat going, then it's possible to use vehicles, with the tractor treads on them, and they of course can move much more quickly than dogs. But in the territory where we're going, the ground is very rough indeed, so we know we can't get vehicles over it, and we intend using the faithful old dog. Well we're going to have a lot of dogs. We think we'll be taking about fifty to sixty dogs down with us, and we'll make these dogs into teams of about nine dogs per team, and we hope to have about six teams. Each team, of course, will pull a sledge. It's really quite astonishing what these huskies will pull. Well if you get a fully loaded sledge, loaded up with food and fuel, weighing about fourteen hundred pounds, over half a ton, well these nine dogs will pull it quite readily, and pull it for day after day. It just shows how strong they are. Well we're not only going to have dogs and sledges, we're going to combine them with the use of aircraft. That was the aircraft ?? thing of course, that Scott and Shackleton and Amundsen didn't have, and that's where we have a big advantage nowadays. These aircraft will be used for the carrying of stores. What will happen is that some of us will take several dog teams, laden down with supplies, and then we'll climb up these glaciers making slow time in the difficult conditions, and when we're about a hundred miles out, or so, we'll send a signal with our little radio back to base, tell them that we have found a place where it's possible for an aircraft to land. Well immediately the aircraft will get loaded up with half a ton of supplies and it'll fly out and join us and land with its skis on the snow, and we'll take all the food out, and then it'll go back for more. In this way we'll be able to build up a dump of supplies, and as soon as there's enough food there, we'll load up the dog teams again, and go on further. Actually we've tried out some of these aircrafts landing on skis only a short while ago, I was down in the southern alps, and in an aircraft there we made the first landings that have ever been made on skis in the New Zealand Alps. Now it really was very exciting indeed. We took off from a little aerodrome, and then the wheels were pulled up and the skis were put in place and we flew up the Tasman glacier, and then landed without any trouble at all at a height of about five thousand feet. Actually I think landing on the snow was much easier than landing anywhere else. But getting off the snow was a much harder business. We turned the aircraft down and started off down the glacier with the engine going as hard as we could, but we went for about a mile and we still couldn't take off, and we wondered a bit whether we were ever going to get off, and finally after we'd done about a mile and a half we seemed to get enough speed up, and the snow flying in every direction, finally we took off the snow, up into the air. Now from that we learnt a good deal, and by now we know it is quite possible to take off and land on the snow quite safely at heights up to seven and eight thousand feet. 

Well we were hoping that the expedition that goes down from New Zealand will be very well equipped indeed, because we have the advantage of all the experience and information that has been gained from Antarctic expeditions over many, many years in the past. And the sort of clothing we'll be wearing, we'll have on our feet of course very warm boots because one of the hardest things to keep warm are your feet. We'll have several types of boots. Some boots are rather like a ski boot, in which you will just wear, say three pairs of socks inside an ordinary leather boot, but this is for just around about camp. When you get into the really cold conditions, you use a boot called a ??. That's rather an unusual name, but it's a name for a boot in which you have a sort of a canvas cover, with a little rubber sole on the bottom, but it's a very large boot indeed, and inside it you wear a couple of pairs of socks, then two or three sort of inner soles made of felt. And these inner boots made of felt keep your feet very warm indeed. Well as well as that, of course, we have windproof clothing, which cover you up from the very strong, cold winds, and then probably the most, the warmest piece of equipment of the lot, are our eiderdown jackets and trousers. These down jackets and trousers are about two inches thick, they're very light indeed and they're full of feather down and they certainly keep you warm under even the most difficult conditions. I have found it very interesting to compare the type of equipment we used in the Himalayas, with that that we'll be using down in the Antarctic. Much of it is very similar indeed. Except that in the Himalayas, where you’re climbing at great altitudes, the main trouble is that you can't carry much because you're relatively weak. So you're very keen indeed to get equipment that is very light, and yet very efficient. Well down in the Antarctic we'll be at much lower levels, and we will have the help of dogs and aircrafts to carry our equipment, so lightness in equipment is perhaps not quite so important. What is more important is that the equipment could be very strong and rugged so that it can last for several years of wear. So our equipment down south will be very strong, well made, and of course capable of combating the tremendous cold that we'll have down there.

Well this gives you some idea of what we have in mind. We're going to have a party of about twenty two men and we're going to spend the long winter nights down there, when there's no daylight at all, preparing for the extensive work we intend doing in the spring. We intend leaving our base and heading out for hundreds of miles onto the Polar Plateau, using our aircraft for supplying us with food and fuel, and we hope to lay bases out as far as we can towards the South Pole, so that we can meet the trans-Antarctic party and bring them safely back to base.
