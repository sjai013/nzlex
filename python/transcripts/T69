trouble, they're all over, and all we can say, all of us, is that thank God that we're all safe.

OK, our first competitor is... May Forrester, I can't even read her name so Harry is screaming it out for us. May Forrester, come up and tell us about, you were born and bred and did everything on Stewart Island.

How long have you been here? Oh, what a question, no, we'll leave that one. But you, tell me, is there a hospital on Stewart Island? 

Well now, what happens when somebody has a baby on Stewart Island? Is there a district nurse, or a midwife?


And some of them go across to ?? I presume, the rather ?? ones go to ??. You're really tough Stewart Islanders.

Um, what, what does your husband do on Stewart Island?

In the fish, fishing boats?

Oh the sheds. 

Do you know, as we were flying over today from ??, we went right over the ??. that's where the oysters are right down there, and you know what I thought? When I sit back in Wellington and we pay thirty cents a dozen for oysters, and I think of the trouble and travail there's quite a strong southerly blowing out there today, and I thought of these fishermen going out there in the wintertime, and we guzzle up four or five dozen oysters and don't think about these blokes. Well I thought of them coming over today. Thanks very much, oyster fleet. I'm only sad that we're not here in the oyster season. Now Mrs Forrester, Christian name again?

May.  What's the name of the proprietess here at the New ?? Hotel?

Well I'd like to thank Mr and Mrs Hobday, they've looked after us with clothing, but unfortunately, everybody who lives on Stewart Island's a dwarf, and they have no clothing to fit me. And I'm doing this performance with a rug wrapped around me, one of Mrs, she gave us coffee and looked after us, and they said the bar will be open after eleven o'clock, of course there are licensing laws, we couldn't go and have even a quick snort. But the blokes at the fishing boats, they had a little bit there.  Um, that's your first question. No, the other explanation, all you people who sent your cards to enter for this competition, they're still lying at the foot of Half Moon Bay. But we've been in touch with them for cargo, there are some there that we can pick up on the way back to ?? tomorrow, so just, if you have written in, write in again to ?? Box 98 Wellington, put your name and address on one side, and your telephone number, and please not letters, because they're difficult to open. If you haven't got a card just address an envelope, stick it down, and put your name and address on the back and we'll draw you out. Now, the people that we would have drawn out today - Oh, there's a boat, is there someone out there trying to get it? No, they can't, I don't think they'll get it in time, because the aircraft's still lying on its back out there - but we will draw more names out of the hat, so you listen at home, you're not going to miss out, we'll draw them out at the ?? show tomorrow and match you up with the people. So Mrs Forrester, you'll be working, you and somebody else. The second question is: what, roughly, is the population of Stewart Island?

That's jolly good. Three hundred and fifty there are. Third question: after whom is Stewart Island named?

And who was Captain Stewart?

What do you mean he was the second one? Only one person can discover anything?

Did he? He didn't even have those oysters?

How many questions have you answered, Mrs Forrester?

You're so right, you win your prize. Harry, what is the prize? Hang on, let's see what your prize is, because there's some listener we're going to select at ?? tomorrow, and we'll know what prize they've got. Don't ask me to read it, I can't see a thing. And we usually select our competitors from beauty.

How about that. ??

Now what do you want. Do you want interior or exterior?

Outside, well that's better to breathe I think, isn't it? Are you going to paint the outside of your house? What colour would you like?

Green and white. We'll arrange for somebody, is there a ?? paint dealer over here on Stewart Island?

Well jolly good, arrange with him and you can go along and help yourself ??.

Well he'll probably want it for the boat. But that's jolly good, Berger paint for the boat, value of fifty dollars. The other prizes are the ?? watch. Now the ?? Swiss watch is there, we didn't have it with us, they sent a sample down for us, fortunately we left it, didn't we, but it's waterproof anyhow, so it wouldn't have come to any harm. We've got the NAC trip between any two New Zealand airports for one, there's the Massport motor mower, that's the premier two motor mower that makes your lawn seem twenty-five percent smaller. Actually, there's a much easier way. I know that the Massport people are very busy, they won't be listening, but the days of motor mowers are gone. All you've got to do is to come down to the ??, get all their slops of beer, you know, when they fill them, they, it spills over, you sprinkle this on your lawn, and you get the dregs from the whiskey and gin bottles, you sprinkle this on the lawn, and your lawns come up half cut. But the Massport is there, there's the ?? tour from Auckland to Wellington, and you connect by NAC, and a big prize for the big final, and  you never know who might be drawn out to enter in the big final is the ?? ?? sixteen inch transistor television set, and also the ?? tour, an eleven day tour from Christchurch to Christchurch all around the south islands for two, and again, NAC will connect. Oh the Ultimate iron of course, that might be in one of the prizes. Who's our second competitor?

Barbara Pointon. Now Barbara, you're a stranger, aren't you?

Where are you from?

I don't think there'd be any Maori MPs listening, so you go right ahead.

What were you doing in South Africa? What sort of job were you doing?

And are you retired now, or are you going to have an electrical business here?

Boy, there's tons of water to fish in, and there's beautiful fish, the Stewart Island, fish is magnificent. Have you been here in our oyster season?

Well you'll have something to look forward to. What about crayfish, do they get those nice big fat juicy crayfish?

Yesterday, it's all ??. Weather was so light you should have been here Thursday. Wednesday we should have been here. Anybody got any crayfish in the pot at home so we can nibble it on the aircraft going back? Huh? No, bad luck. Ah, questions about South Africa. What place in South Africa reminds you of a piece of furniture?

Yes, there's a place in South Africa reminds you of a piece of furniture.

Table Mountain. What a difficult question. The second question has to do with the North of England. The North of England. Well think of a question from the north of England. Name, I'll tell you what, name three soccer teams that have come from the North of England.

Newcastle United, yes.

?? yes.

?? Liverpool.

Oh that's marvellous, yes good question. Give her a nice hand for that. Your third question is: the Mersey tunnel runs under what river?

How clever you are. Three questions. Somebody, somebody who's fate will be decided tomorrow in ??, because we haven't got our things here at Stewart Island, somebody who's fate will be decided tomorrow will be going for the same prize with you. Harry, that ball point pen at Harry's writes under water. Marvellous. I've often wondered, let's see, just put your hand in there and pick out something interesting. Could be the Massport motor mower, could be that Ultimate steam and dry iron, could be that trip by ANC.

Steam and dry iron.

That's fabulous, as you wouldn't have brought an iron out with you?

Hasn't brought an iron out, her husband's an electrical contractor, they always say that the cobbler's children are the worst shod.

Well thank you very much. Indeed I'd forgotten your name already. Our next competitor, Harry?

Gwen Lewis. Harry's on the air, so Mrs Hall is alright you see, he's still got his voice. Gwen, how long have you been at Stewart Island.

Just over - where did you come from originally?

Hawk's Bay to Stewart Island? There must be a story behind this.

When did this happen?

What was your maiden name in Hawk's Bay?

Oh yes, yes ??

Then your husband, is he down here or did you meet him in Hawk's Bay? Where did you meet him?

You met at Stewart Island, you came back to his loving arms. What does he do on Stewart Island?

What was your maiden name in Hawk's Bay, so that our listeners up there can say that

Lewis. Your Christian name then is?

Gwendolyn. It's Gwen Lewis from Hawk's Bay, here she is trying to, you don't know any questions, you don't know any answers about Stewart Island?

Well let's start in the North Island then. What is the road between Napier and ?? called?

Napier ?? Highway, that's very very good indeed. The most prominent feature in Napier is called what?

Geographical, yes.

The Bluff Hill is ?? right. There are two, there are two marine lands in New Zealand, where are they?

One is in Napier, correct. Where is the second one?

No, no I don't think that, by golly, I might have found out this morning if it is in Heaven, you know. I'm assuming, of course.

You can ask me a question.

The other one's in the North Island, correct. And it's north of Napier and it, whoops, I'm losing the, losing the blanket.

Not Auckland, have another crack at it. A little south of Auckland, on the coast, because it's a marine land.

?? look at that for an answer. What ??, what ??. When, just remember Harry's soggy coat. I'm so glad, you wool growers I wore my woollen suit over, and a woollen jersey. I must apologise to you people that the sitting room here at the ?? hotel looks like a Chinese laundry, but we're trying to dry out, because I just can't imagine what the NAC passengers are going to say when we arrive at, back in ?? wrapped in a rug. What's the prize?

An Ultimate steam and dry iron, are we having a picnic down here, you'll all be ironing. That's marvellous. Thank you very much indeed. Harry have a look at your watch and tell us what the time is, would you?

Fifteen minutes gone, fifteen minutes gone.

It's ten minutes to twelve, how about that. Who's our next competitor now? Tell us more about Stewart Island. Come right up here and tell us your name in a loud, clear voice.

Maureen Jones, how long have you been at Stewart Island?

Well how long? All your life too?

Were you born here?

Where were you born?

You're another of these southerners. You sure get around.

How far north of ?? have you been in your lifetime?

As far as the Chateau. That's not bad, you left the northern part of the North Island out. They don't come down here, so why should you go up there.

Let me tell you people about Stewart Island. A wonderful place for a holiday. As we came in before, we came in and intended to land, we did have a flip around. There are some gorgeous bays over here, absolutely heavenly. At the, of course you can come across here in a couple of hours by boat, you can come across in the amphibian. Wonderful place for a holiday. There's the hotel here, there's a guesthouse, there are a lot of cribs that are available aren't they Mrs Hobday, for rent at holiday times?

Oh what's wrong? Is that your little monster? Well go you go and nurse her then, she'll feel happier. You go and put her in your arms. I want to talk about Firestone country, yesterday we left ?? in the morning and it was snowing, believe it or not, and was I glad that we had Firestone F7 tires on our car, because it can be a bit treacherous driving in snow. Now with Firestone F7 you are sure that you're travelling safely, and remember, it's the holiday weekend coming up, so make sure that you've got good tyres on your car, particularly if you’re going through some of the rougher country that we've been through recently, not that the road from ??'s rough, it's a magnificent highway, but we were a little concerned, we've got a very heavily laden station wagon, and it's pretty hard work on the tyres. But with Firestone F7, you're sure that you've got good grip in snow, rain, wind, it doesn't matter, those Firestones will stick you to the road. And that's where it's important in cars, where the tyres meet the road is the important thing. You fit Firestone F7. Shall we talk about the Pye television set now? I think we'd better, the Pye sixteen.

Now there's a thing they say at the end, that the name doesn't go on until the quality's proved, with the Pye television set. Do you have television over here on Stewart Island? If you're going to replace your set get a Pye. They go from the sixteen inch transistor portable right up to the twenty-five inch luxury set in the Pye television range. If you want radio, if you want television, Pye. P-Y-E, that's the name to remember. Now, stand up, oh you've got your little girl there, that's fine. Little girl or little boy?

Is that pink or blue? I can't see.

Oh that's good. What's his name?

Megan, I'm sorry. Megan. That's your first question answered. How old is Megan?

One what?

Oh, jolly good. Has she got any brothers or sisters?

One brother, one sister? Isn't that marvellous. You're really, this is how you're going to plan your family, one boy one girl, one boy one girl?

Now you said this, what did you do when you went up to the Chateau, as a matter of interest?

You went skiing. You passed Coronet Peak to go to the Chateau? And do you prefer skiing at Coronet Peak or at the Chateau, just tell me?

That's what I say is the laziest skiing I've ever heard, 'I just stand on the sideline and watch'. How are we going for time, Harry? Tell the customers what the time is.

Six minutes to twelve. You've answered two questions. Here is your -

One? No, we asked her the name of the baby and her age. Two, yes let’s be really generous today, let’s, let’s show our gratitude in some tangible way. What does your husband do?

He's a - does anybody do anything on Stewart Island except fish? 

No, apart from that. 

We have carpenters, we have hoteliers, we have, how many retired people? Are there many retired people? This must be a wonderful place to retire to.

Oh, that's marvellous. But your husband's a fisherman?

What time does he go out? How do these fishermen work from here, do they go out all day or do they go out for a week at a time or?
