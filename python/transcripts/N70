I can't say what's responsible for this attitude of mine on the part of the public, but the fact remains that there is a considerable section of the community which thinks that parliament ought to govern. I've taken every opportunity I can of pointing out that eighty people of very different views, eighty-four now, simply can't run the country. They must delegate their powers to a smaller group, and that smaller group being the group which the majority in parliament, the government side of the House appoints as the cabinet. It's the cabinet which runs the country, not Parliament.

I don't think I used the term 'major subjects', and in any case a lot depends on what you mean by that term. I've had the feeling for some time that one of the problems is that parties, this applies to the National Party and the Labour Party in New Zealand, put too much into their policy. In other words, they commit themselves to too much beforehand. And the member feels that having been committed to these different lines of action, he is bound, when he speaks on these matters in the House, to support them through thick and thin, not withstanding the fact that circumstances may have changed to justify his taking a different attitude. Now I can't help feeling that we need more of the British attitude here. I would remind you for example that in connection with Britain's entry into the common market, there is quite a strong and influential body of opinion, including the former president of the Board of Trade, Mr Douglas Jay, which is opposed to Government policy in this connection. Now this is a really big issue, and an issue on which apparently back bench members of both parties feel that they have a perfect right to express a viewpoint in view of the fact that there is, in the country, so much controversy on this issue. And you imagine in New Zealand if members were permitted to express their individual viewpoints rather than the Party viewpoints on ??

Well when you say we have had change, yes there has been change, but in this connection may I say that what always puzzles, what has puzzled me recently is why the agitation that has grown so strongly now didn't happen ten years ago.

Oh yes, I think that's true, I think that's, that must be true of the government, particularly if its majority is narrowing, and it ought also to be true of the Opposition.

Well I can see the difficulty. I think that once a member or at least a candidate for Parliament stands on the platform of a particular party which has pledged itself to carry out a particular piece of legislation, or to undertake a matter of administration, he is bound to support that policy, his electors expect him to do so. On the other hand, I think that if parties left to the parliament of the day the decision on other issues, in which it didn't feel it necessary to make a party stand at the time of the election, we'd get much more freedom in parliament, and I think Parliament would be listened to with much more interest than is the case at the present time where people have the attitude that, well their minds are made up beforehand anyway, they can't say what they really think, we don't know what this fellow really means, even though what he is saying appears to mean something different.

Well of course there is in caucus an opportunity for everyone to express his opinion honestly, and as you know there are some issues which are left to the individual member, like issues on licensing and sometimes on gambling and matters of that kind, where moral considerations come in. There are quite different attitudes that are adopted by different members. Sometimes the differences are not so much differences of principle as differences of method and of timing, and it's these which are discussed fully in caucus, and I must say that in caucus there is a much freer discussion of the merits of a case than there is when the matter comes before the House when the Party line is determined.

No, I, there's never been pressure to, in the normal sense of that term. There has generally been a consensus arrived at, and that consensus expresses itself in the House.

That right. And I think what the public want to know is the open discussion and the, and they would be much more interested if that could be heard in public. I don't think you could have you could possibly have the press present in caucus, although one sometimes wonders if they're not there. But the plain fact is that people must just assume certain things have happened in caucus, they might wish that the discussion that had taken place had, did take place in fact in Parliament itself.

Yes, well now you raise an interesting point here. I have felt for some time that we need more committee work, and incidentally, I think that in recent years we are seeing Parliament at its best, in the parliamentary select committees. Some members do most valuable work there, and the interesting thing is that in a committee, a member expresses his honest viewpoint, he tries to look at the evidence and, and to come to a conclusion on the facts as he sees them, and the Party viewpoint is subordinated to that. Now, if the press were present, I have a suspicion that members might not be so willing as they are at the present time, to express their honest viewpoint and to differ from the Party line, particularly as in New Zealand and I suppose in most countries, somebody who differs from the party is regarded as siding with the opposition, and selling out, and being a traitor and so on. Well there are some member who mightn't be disposed to take that risk.

Not necessarily.

Yes, I think that, I think when you come to the negotiation, to the discussion and the final decision, that obviously must be a matter where members sit round the table and discuss matters frankly and where the press could not possibly be present.

I don't think some members take full advantage of the opportunities that are offered to them to make a contribution to the House. I think there are some who perhaps speak too much, there are some who don't speak enough, and possibly it's true also to say that some of them don't study enough the subject upon which they intend to speak. Parliament nowadays being broadcast, it's particularly important that members should be well informed. They're not always well informed, not as well informed as they might be.

Yes, I think as a matter of fact that the New Zealand member is badly treated as far as secretarial and other assistance is concerned. This differs immensely from the rank and file member in other countries, and particularly does apply to the United States. Incidentally, I have noted a suggestion, I think I mentioned this, and you may have intended to question me on it, it's the question of whether the Party, particularly the Opposition party, shouldn't be given more information, more real information, more up to date information than is available to it at the present time. We were told at the recent Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference by the Canadian delegates, that they had taken steps in Canada to keep the Opposition properly informed, and to give it as much information as could possibly be given to it, other than ultra secret information, and so that when the matter came before the House for discussion, they would have the information at their fingertips and be just as well informed as Government happen to be on this particular subject.

Yes, well I find here a great difficulty in coming to a final conclusion. I have the feeling that the method that has been adopted in the Labour Party of having three people from the local Labour representation committee and three people from the national executive of the Party make the choice. I've had the feeling that that gives the impression to the people in the electorate that they, they have little say in the nominee selected. Now I know that feeling does exist, and I can't help believing that while the national executive of the Party, or the central executive or whatever it may be called, while that executive should have some say in vetoing somebody who is, or at least vetoing a decision who would give them somebody in Parliament who might not be up to it, I think that's something that should be exercised or a right that should be exercised only rarely, and that the individual electorate should be given a greater say, but perhaps the, with some guidance from the central committee as to the kind of candidate they want without saying that A is better than B.

Well the new method, of course, of determining the number of seats in the House will gradually lead us to a larger Parliament, and my own view is that a larger Parliament is desirable. The I think that nowadays people are mindful of the need, when they ask electing candidates, they're mindful of the need of selecting candidates who are likely to acquit themselves well in the House, who have the knowledge and experience that's necessary. We have of course a higher proportion of university graduates in the House nowadays than was the case, say twenty years ago, although I'm bound to say that some university graduates have disappointed me in the contributions which in fact they have made. And although some members of the House may not, to use a term you used earlier, be up to it, the plain fact is that their knowledge in their particular field, it may be a narrow field, may be of considerable values, and after all, Parliament is a representative institution.

Yes, yes, admittedly I am not sure that I would go with you that it ought to be as high as that at the present time, I think that somewhere around the hundred mark should be the limit, once we get to that mark we should cry halt. However that won't come for some years yet. The point that you raise here is very interesting, because one of the things that must puzzle a prime minister or the leader of a new party who hopes to become a prime minister, is where to find the material that he really wants for a cabinet adequate in size. Now after all, the present what, the present numbers of the present government party are forty four, they have, what is it, nineteen members of cabinet, and in addition to that they have to find two under secretaries, a speaker, a chairman of committees and so on, after all, with all possible respect to those who have been appointed, I think the Prime Minister may have been at a disadvantage in the selection that he had to make. And that would apply to any party where the proportion of members who are regarded as desirable in cabinet is so high as it is at the present time.

No, no I think we should reverse the process, we should reduce the size of Cabinet. I don't see the need for a cabinet of the size we have in New Zealand today.

Well I think that inevitably if you have men in cabinet positions who are incapable of grasping the full implications of their portfolio and of their department, that inevitably the public servant must play a larger part in making public policy. The ideal public servant will of course inform his minister of the facts, endeavour to persuade him in a certain direction, but make it very clear to him that it's his responsibility as Minister to make the decision. Otherwise you have that worst of all faults in a democracy, the bureaucratic rule.

I think that while some people believe that it would be possible for Parliament to pick its best men and say those men
