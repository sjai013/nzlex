A favourite people, the shut ins. It was around Daisy that I learned very early in my career some important lessons for any commercial broadcaster.


Well this is my fifty-first year in radio in New Zealand. In 1934 I appeared in my first radio play, I had two words to say, it was '??', and for that I received the sum of ten and sixpence, but I had to wear a dinner jacket. It was a live radio play. In those days the radio plays relied on amateurs and generally amateur producers, there were no, there were no professional producers in the broadcasting area, they would get people from Wellington repertory and people like George Swan, for instance, would produce plays. And so that's how I came into broadcasting, through working in repertory and the Thespians as an amateur actor. That was the only pool that they had to draw on for radio drama. And then just prior to the war, when Professor Shelley, Sir James Shelley took over, he brought Bernard Beebey in, and the he was the first professional producer that they had. And even in those days, we produced the plays in off-office times, because people couldn't get away from their work, people solicitors, lawyers, were always very strong in the amateur drama. And then there were lots of other people too, and we used to work in the lunch hour, between one and two we'd record a slot of a play, then we'd come back between five and seven and do another one. That was immediately prior to the war. Then of course during the war, the radio drama section was used in the main, I think, for propaganda. But Bernard Beebey laid the foundation for New Zealand radio drama, the professional radio drama. I came back from the war on leave, and I ran into Bernard in Featherstone St, and he said 'Look, we're desperate for actors, would you come along', which I didn't take as much as a compliment, mind you. I was very happy to do it, because I came back on three months leave, and then that leave was extended for another two months, so I had five months before I went back to the middle east in 1945, to find, when I arrived there, the war was over. Then when I came back to New Zealand, the, what do they call them, the Labour, what is now Labour Department, they decided I should become a tram conductor. That didn't appeal to me very much, so I decided that radio was the only way I could make a living. I had been a theatre manager in Wellington for the ?? organisation, and I realised that Mr Kerridge?? wouldn't be terribly pleased with me to come back and manage the Majestic Theatre, all the old ?? blokes coming in and wanting free seats, so I decided to give away theatre management. That's how I came into, into radio, and of course, some weeks you'd earn twenty pounds, some weeks you'd earn thirty pounds, it was a very precarious existence, but I was the really the first professional actor who relied entirely on radio as, as a living. Then there were other programs of course, that came by the way, and then there were national film unit, national film unit commentaries. And that's how I came into broadcasting. And then when John Maybury left New Zealand to go to Australia he suggested to the advertising agency, to ?? that I should take over the programs that he was doing, and from then on of course it's, it's a pretty well known story, that I was involved with five or six, seven or eight programs in the radio days.

Never. Never have been, and I don't think I ever would

Well no, I don't think it was on purpose. I did a lot of contract work, I did a breakfast session at 2ZB on contract. But I knew that there was an undercurrent with the permanent staff members, they couldn't see why a contractor should be paid more than a permanent staff member, which of course the only reason was that we didn't, we had no superannuation, we had no definite tenure and it, it was a pretty you know, you didn't know where you were from week to week.

No I see it as, as, as acting. You act a part, you take on the role of a quizmaster, you take on the role of a continuity announcer, you take on the role of a musical introducer - I introduced 'The Lever Hit parade' for years. You assume that role as an actor, that wasn't me, and I think that if you go back over those programs you would see that there's a different personality came up, in 'the Lever Hit Parade' I had a different image, for instance, from 'It's in the Bag' or from 'Luck's Money go Round' or 'Bird's Eye View of the World'. It was a different person, you were playing a part. The nearest that that, the nearest that I've got to it is in 'Beauty and the Beast', of being myself on the media.

Well quiz programs of course, in those, in those days of radio and the days of peak radio, and I'm talking now of the fifties, the sixties and then the gradual decline, but the guts of commercial broadcasting in those days was the quiz program. There was the Jack Maybury programs, which were taken over after his death by John, then Sandy Triggs did some quiz programs for Nestles??, he was working with me for some time, and then he went over to Nestles and did radio programs for them. But you see we were doing, we were doing one two three four five, between us we were doing about seven quiz programs a week in peak time. And that was when the peak audience, that's what the audience wanted. And I can never understand why the quiz program hasn't assumed the same stature in television as it did on radio, I presume it was cost.  You see in America the quiz programs are all daytime. In Australia they're all daytime, except there was one program, 'Cole's Seven Thousand Dollar Quiz' or something. It was nighttime. But generally they went into game shows for television. But we'll come to that later.

Television came in at the time when broadcasting was changing its, its whole image, in that about the time that television started, it ceased to become a government department. Now on the thirty-first of March, I forget what year it was, anybody working for the, on the payroll of broadcasting was a civil servant. Now you can't on the first of April suddenly become not a civil servant, and over the years fortunately its the, natural attrition is having its part. But there were so many of the, civil service - I don't want to mention them by name, naturally - but there were so many who were civil service orientated, who couldn't see beyond the civil service rulebook. And this was one of the inhibiting things, as far as television was concerned, in those very early days. And of course the lack of money, you know, they started off on a shoestring. When you think of the appalling accommodation we had at ?? Street, the appalling accommodation they had in Christchurch and in Auckland. Auckland hasn't improved a great deal, incidentally. They're still working in the old, in the old ?? Street studios. And all makeshift. At least in Wellington we've got studios that were built as a television complex, whether you agree with how Avalon is operating or not is beside the point, but that, it's the only part of television that was built and designed to handle television, the rest of it's been makeshift from the very start, which is quite extraordinary that they've done so well.

Oh yes the people, the people that have come into it are now a different breed of people, the people in television, they're far more liberal in their ideas, their the producers have a little more independence I think than they had under the old days, you're going back into the days of when Terry Brian, for instance was under the restriction of, of having civil servants or ex civil servants on top of him, found it very limiting. But there were some marvellous people in those days who were producers. Malcolm Kent is an example. He was a cameraman in those early days in ?? Street, a boy in short pants virtually, now head of entertainment, and a man for whom I have the greatest admiration. But as far as the prod - Cam Sidell of course has gone out of it now, he's, he's in the, he's in the film unit. But Chris Bourne was one of the early producers and then was syphoned off and went into management, which was a pity I think, because Chris Bourne had a, had a great deal of talent as a producer and a director. And of course this is what people don't understand, that the difference between a producer and a director. The producer is the man who handles the purse strings, the director is the man who handles the cameras and decides what shots you're going to get, and he's a very important man. And he can ruin anybody's career. If anybody tries the heavy on a director, he's he's finished as far as television's concerned. This didn't apply in radio, but it certainly does in television. He can call those shots that can put you in the worst possible light. And I've always got on well with my producers and directors, and I'm very thankful for that.

No no no, not not in television.

No, no I do I do a lot, I've got a lot of confidence in really a Pacific particularly for the age group that my, the products I'm associated with, and I've had great success with Radio Pacific on their talk back programs, they've always been very generous with time, I can ring Derek Lowe any time and say 'look, I want to talk for an hour on the ?? time share apartments, and Derek will say 'it's yours'. Okay, they do some advertising as well, but we don't get this opportunity on radio New Zealand, and that audience, the audience that's listening to radio Pacific are the age group that I'm looking for.

Conductor, I wasn't good enough to be a driver.

No, no because, well, it it was a matter of earning the living the best way you could. See I'd been hopeless, I wasn't an academic, I'd had limited success as far as the army was concerned, I was in sort of a rut. I'd held the same job for four years in divisional headquarters as ammunition officer, so I, there was nothing else I could do. I didn't have any academic, I'd've liked to be a lawyer and I'm delighted that our son has done well in the profession, but I didn't have the brains to become a lawyer, a lot of people came back from the war at my age of thirty, whatever was it, thirty-one, thirty-two and went  to university, studied and became teachers, or lawyers or scientists. I didn't have that application, I didn't have the brains to do that.

It's it's knowledge that I've picked up. You see I'm a great, we're both Cynny and I are great crossword puzzlers and it's incredible how often, just out of the blue, the other day there was a clue and I wrote it down straight away, Martello tires/tiles??, and Cynny said 'I've never heard of the Martello Tiles, well I've obviously read it in getting, you see in all the quiz programs I've done the questions myself. So I've done a tremendous amount of encyclopaedia reading, picking up useless information, like, for instance, the Martello Tiles, that suddenly in a crossword puzzles it comes up and it's there. I don't have a good retention, I'm more of a practical person than, you know, getting, studying from books, I'm not, I was never very good at it.

Oh yes. 

Oh yes, oh yes. I I'd I have no doubt, I have no doubt that had I decided to go to Australia, that I could have done well in Australia. I had no desire to go to Australia to live, I, in the meantime when I came back from the war we married and we had a family. We had all sorts of ideas when we were first married, my wife being a registered nurse, that we'd go to England and I'd - I'd've liked to have become an actor in Britain, and again to be frank, I think I'd've done well. I did very well in amateur theatricals in New Zealand, there are still people who remember parts that I played. I think that I could've made it. For all the people who are unemployed in the theatre, I think I could've made it on the English stage. But I'm quite happy with I've spent my life in New Zealand. I vouch for if I had my time again I doubt if I'd change anything.

Oh no no.

No no no I just like our lifestyle, and every time I come back from overseas I think know lucky we are to live in this country. There's a lot that I don't like about it, but then wherever you live it's the same. No I'm very happy to be a New Zealander, and I'm very happy to be a big fish in a small pond.
