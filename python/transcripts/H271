I really have no idea, to tell you honest truth. The, when I look back on my early years, in fact look back on my parents and my grandparents, I suppose we all benefit to some degree from heredity. I had, one of my grandmothers was a rather remarkable lady from Northern Ireland. 

She was, had a great deal of spirit and strength, and determination, and she lived to a ripe old age of ninety three, and I think she was a remarkable woman actually, and I suppose my father was a, a fairly, was a very energetic and reasonable obstreperous sort of character, who did have I think a lot of drive and terrific ability to work. So I suppose inevitably one picks up some of these characteristics from one's parents and grandparents. 

I can't really, I don't really feel that there's a sort of a clear pattern emerged in my childhood, I always seemed to be in a way a bit of an outsider, I think, as far as my schooling was concerned, I was never very happy, particularly at secondary school, I certainly didn't feel that I fitted in particularly well with the school activities, and even after that, up to the age of twenty one and so on, I really felt that sort of rather a lonely, independent person, who was perhaps searching mentally for some sort of solution to some of the problems that seemed to be round about, but not by any means a mature or stable, or perhaps even a solid member of society, I just sort of was, I think uncertain, insecure, and frequently quite bloody minded in my approach to many of the problems of that day.

Yes, that's true. I, I think in many ways actually the, travelling by train as I used to do every day to Auckland Grammar, I used to catch the train at seven in the morning and get back home about six fifteen at night. In many ways particularly the trip home on the train for a couple of hours became the happiest part of the day for me, in that was the time the schoolwork was over, and what few friends I had more or less travelled on the train, I could read books quietly in a corner and we could get involved in all the skylarking and foolish things that young people do, and I really think I quite enjoyed this.

No, I would say I really can't remember too many individuals who've strongly influenced me in my life at all. I think in many ways I've been more influenced by the things I disagreed with almost than the things or the people that I strongly agreed with. This is not to say that I didn't appreciate I think, the people who were involved in my life, even though I fought with my father like fury all through my teens, I always in many ways had quite a respect for him, and a certain sense of loyalty, but that didn't mean that I didn't argue with him, which I certainly did.

Yes, my reading I suppose would be regarded as being fairly light. I found that a great deal of time, a certain stage particularly in my life, I more or less escaped from the world into the realms of imagination, and I was a tremendous reader of books like Rider Haggard and John Buchan and all those sort of rather imaginative, adventurous sort of things. 

And when I wasn't reading a book, I seemed to be a good deal of the time living in my imagination and putting myself in all sorts of fantastic, romantic situations, in which of course I was always dying heroically here or rescuing someone there. The, although I feel now that obviously one couldn't do this all one's life, because nothing whatsoever would actually happen, in many ways it was I think perhaps a useful escape, as far as I was concerned, away from a life which, in which I felt sort of repressed and subdued, and I really don't think it in the end it did too much harm.

Not so much at the time, I think. I more or less accepted the sort of John Buchan approach that the sort of, all the heroes more or less inevitably were from the upper stratas of society, and so on. But they were heroes who were painted in a sympathetic sort of a way who didn't mind perhaps sleeping with one of the lower classes and all the rest of it, they were people who would share dangers and difficulties, and I didn't find this too bad, but it was strongly counteracted by the fact of course, that I was brought up in a house that during the depression my father was, had very strong views on all sorts of social questions of course, as many New Zealanders did.

So we were intended to be swept along by this feeling of the need for social change, resentment perhaps against the establishment, which it seemed to have little sympathy for such changes, and I think these factors probably played a much bigger part in my life that books like John Buchan.

No, I don't think beekeeping had much to do with it. You know a lot of ideas about beekeeping is the sort of thing that you retire gently too, and you wander around among the flowers and so on and become philosophical. This may be true perhaps in the type of amateur beekeeping that goes on, but commercial beekeeping is quite a different proposition. It's a very high pressure, hardworking, a lot of physical energy is required, in many ways it's a lot of excitements, and disappointments. 

The honey crop comes along and all the hives swarm at once, and you're working twenty hours a day to secure your honey crop. And then of course bad weather comes and next moment you're not getting any crop at all. And in many ways I enjoyed this challenge, and even the disappointments, you're always optimistic that next week things will be better, or next year there'll be a better crop. And even though this life was a very uncertain one, and money was very uncertain indeed in our household, I really think on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed the beekeeping, and I enjoyed throwing myself physically, almost violently physically into the physical work involved.

The, my brother and I used to always race each other, carrying loads. We rarely ever carried an eighty-pound box of honey just walking, we would jog, and if we weren't racing each other we'd be racing against the clock. I don't know why we did it, really, but this, to us at the time this added sort of a spice of life to the whole thing, and we certainly did put out a great deal of physical effort.

No I don't think it was the reflective aspect at all that appealed to me, I didn't even think of it being reflective. It was the once again, I think the opportunity for freedom of action and for energetic violent exercise, I think this is very, was a very important factor. I really started largely by initially tramping when my, I think probably eighteen or nineteen I did quite a bit of tramping in the ?? with a group of young people, and I enjoy just sort of bashing around and driving myself. 

I'd found I was reasonably energetic physically, and never seemed to run out of energy much, and I enjoyed just pushing myself and rushing around the country and when I changed to mountaineering at a later date, the, there's no doubt at all in a way I think was more a personal challenge more than anything else, the fact of constantly being scared and yet not permitting this to stop you going on, as it were, and the, although I was constantly dissatisfied perhaps with what I did or was able to do, I always liked to feel at the end of a climb even though I'd been petrified half the time, firstly that I hadn't shown it too much, and secondly that I had been able to keep going and in the end sort of reached the top or whatever we were doing.

 So there's no doubt at all that the challenge of it, the physical discomfort and even the fear involved in it was one of the substantial attractions. Of course I enjoyed the views and the comradeship and so on of other members of the party, this was tremendously important, but there's no doubt too that the sense of challenge and the sense of achieving that you get by overcoming your fears was quite a considerable factor.

Oh Harry had a terrific influence on me. Till I met Harry the, he was just a name, he was sort of the most famous of all New Zealand climbers at the time. And I had been doing some quite nice little climbing round about the place and feeling reasonably pleased with myself, but meeting up with Harry and climbing with Harry sort of moved me up into a different league, as it were, and I learnt a tremendous lot from climbing with him.

 He's, I still regard him as one of the finest technical climbers that I have ever met, and his skills, which of course to some degree are different from the skills of a modern day climber, because techniques have changed, but I haven't the slightest doubt if he'd been climbing today he'd be equally competent and as a modern climber with these skills, and head and shoulders above the vast majority.

Well I had my, you know I wondered a bit just what the effect would be. I always remember we, when we joined up with the party, Earl Ridderford?? and I, a northern New Zealander, we had come in after the, Eric Shipton's party, and we crossing through Nepal in the Monsoon. And in order to catch up with them in a high village, we did about a two days march and we left some of our loads behind and we ground up this tremendously long hill for about five thousand feet, where we knew they were. 

And I always remember as we approached the village just wondering whether all my sort of ideals were going to be dissipated by meeting Eric, but no, this wasn't the case at all. For some reason because these were the first English climbers really I'd ever had anything to do with, I think I expected them to be dressing for dinner, and being frightfully pukka and all the rest of it, while I can assure you I'd never seen anything as decrepit looking than Eric Shipton was. And he had a great, very very easy manner and great warmth, and so on, and before long we were very much one of the party. 

The thing was that I discovered with Eric and ?? of every person of any consequence, they have various aspects of various things in which they excel. And they are human, so that in many ways they are far less competent and as I discovered with Eric that some things he's not terribly good at, that some things I was a lot better at that he was. But as far as the spirit driving him on to explore, the desire to look over into the next valley, to climb the next peak and so on, I don't think I've ever met anybody with a stronger spirit than this, and he was reported to prepare to put up with any discomfort and hardship in his desire to explore. So this was a thing I had to respect and enjoy, and no Eric was a great, it was life to me, the time I spent with Eric Shipton, he is quite a remarkable man.

I don't really think I thought too deeply about it. Initially I found it difficult to accept the emotional reaction sort of that the world seemed to have at the time at our particular success. It did all seem a bit on the exaggerated side, after all amongst ourselves we all agreed that what we just climbed a mountain was a big one, and we felt quite a lot of the satisfaction out of doing it.

 But we did realise very quickly that we climbed the right mountain at the right time. The world seemed to want people to have done something like that at that time, so I think perhaps we benefited a great deal from the right climate as it were, in world feelings. I've always rather in a sense not resented, but disliked the suggestion that because you climbed something like Everest or do something else similar, that life more or less stops then, that you spend the rest of your life referring back to the day you did this particular feat. 

I certainly refuse to either accept this or do it. I realise that the climb of Everest was a tremendously important occasion for me, it made a great deal of difference about what I did in later life, but I like to feel that it was just one incident, perhaps, in a sort of a long line of incidents which I hope will go on for a quite a lot longer.

No, I don't feel nostalgic in the slightest. Everest you see is a……HILLARY 722
