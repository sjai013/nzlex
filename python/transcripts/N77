Let me correct something here, you know. I think you probably got that from the New Zealand encyclopaedia, but it's wrong about the dates. I was born on the seventh of February 1901.

That's right, yes. Well first of all, as you say I was born in ?? My father had married my mother, who was a widow with three young children. I was the first child of the second marriage, and we lived in ?? for a couple of years, until I went, my parents went to Alexandra, in central ?? where I went through the primary school there.

Oh yes, very definitely.

Both, they were both religious, my mother particularly so. It was wrong to whistle on Sunday. It was wrong to dance. It was several things were wrong which I've accepted as quite proper today. It was very much of a puritan home, if I may put it that way.

Yes, yes it was, perhaps with some of the exceptions that occur in normal married lives. I was very much influenced by my mother, who was a lovely woman, and who was good in the very best sense of that term.

I have always been imbued with a desire to serve. This seemed to me the best way, at that time, of serving the community. I felt that here was an opportunity to serve, and I accepted the ordination as a Presbyterian minister, went to ?? in North Otago. That was, I was there for ten years before I resigned and stood for the ?? seat in Parliament.

Yes, without any reservations.

Well there were two things. First of all I felt that my ministry was not the success that I hoped it might have been. I suppose we all, in that position, have our disappointments, as I had mine, but what motivated me most was the fact that during the later part of my ministry there was established in my parish, a new hydro electric scheme known as ?? hydro. Men came there from all over New Zealand, and the conditions under which they worked, the conditions under which they arrived were appalling. This, I think, was the factor which influenced me most in deciding to or at least agreeing to stand for the ?? seat at the 1935 election. At that election I was, contrary to many expectations, elected, and I retained that seat for some fourteen years. Some people regarded it as a miracle that I won it, I regard it as a miracle that I held it for fourteen years.

Oh you may, you have, it's been called worse than that I tell you. I don't regard it as a black budget at all, and in the light of some budgets recently presented, my budget was very mild. If at that time men had been asked to pay for their beer as much as they are paying today, I think there would have been a revolution in the country.

Well I think the greatest controversy was caused over the over the increase in beer prices, and in cigarettes and tobacco. There were other features of the budget which some people didn't like, but there wasn't the same objection to them as there was to the raising of beer taxes. Now my own feeling was that at that time what I did was the proper course to take, and actually the later years I think vindicated my budget, because we got onto a very even keel in 1960, and unfortunately from that time we appear to have degenerated.

That's right, yes. Mr Nash as he then was, retired, and I became the leader, but I remained leader for only three years. Many of my party felt that the public would never forgive my black budget and that it would be unwise to retain me as leader. I think they were wrong, but still, that was over to them, and they decided by quite a substantial majority, that somebody else should be chosen in my stead.

That's right, yes.

Oh, fairly good. He wasn't an easy man to get along with. His procrastination was most frustrating on occasion, but he had a lot of likeable qualities too and we got along pretty well together. While I was Minister of Finance I enjoyed his confidence as the Prime Minister, and he stood by me all the way If some others in the party has been as, had been as loyal as he was, I think the result in 1960 might have been different.

Ooo it was a passion. As a matter of fact he had the acquisitive instinct, but it was wasn't confined so much to money as to paper, and he retained paper of very little value, and those who had to go through those papers have blessed him in the lack of wisdom he showed in selecting the papers that might be useful.

I suppose I did. It was a surprise to me quite frankly, for a number of reasons that I don't need to disclose, but I think they might have gone about it in a different way.

Well, it wasn't quite so being left without a week, I preferred to move quickly from my office, I didn't want to stay in the wings any longer, and as far as I was concerned I was prepared to retire gracefully, and I managed to clean up my office in a week and allow him therefore to come into office because it was thought by some in the party that all that was needed was a change of leadership and the party would immediately be returned to government. It didn't turn out that way.

He was a difficult man to assess, a man of moods. I don't want to be harsh in my criticism because it might be felt that because of my position I was biased. But being as objective as I can, I think Norman had some qualities that would have made him a great leader, but unfortunately there were deficiencies in his nature that showed up when he did become leader and particularly when he became Prime Minister.

Oh very definitely. That was more evident to others in the party than to me, but it was very evident when he became Prime Minister, that that was one of his troubles. And there were fields in which he was not outstandingly proficient, and I'm thinking particularly of finance and economics. He would have been much wiser to leave that to others and to concentrate on those fields where he was proficient.

That's possible. I've never known that on occasions just what it was that made me so unpopular, if that was one of the things I can understand it. They would of course have other reasons they would term them why I was unpopular, but if they counted that as one, who am I to complain.

I personally think that. It's regarded as part of the game, and ministers and members are expected to socialise, as you term it. My own feeling is that too much time is wasted on that, and that ministers would be much wiser to concentrate on their main job.

I am, I have just finished a task which was imposed upon me by the compensation, the Accident Compensation Commission, of investigating the freezing works and the un, what was regarded as the undue incidence of accident claims in that industry. I have finished with that now, and the, I am a government appointee on what is known as Offshore Mining Company Limited, which is the half part, the government's half of Maori Development Limited. I'm also a director of the Reserve Bank, and I am a director of an investment, at least a superannuation investment company.

Yes, justifiably so I think. And although, as I expected there have been loud noises from certain quarters, I think most medical men know what's been going on. They are as concerned about it as I have been and as the commission is, and I think they will take steps to deal with the matter because unfortunately, these few doctors who are not playing the game are bringing the profession into disrepute.

As such yes. If you mean am I in favour of everything in the act, then I would have to say no, I think that there are some things in it which may have been a mistake. But nevertheless the general principle of the act I agree with.

Yes, yes I think there is no doubt about that. Let me make it clear that I don't think they're confined to the freezing industry, although there are too many in the freezing industry who are bringing disrepute to the scheme. And my concern is that the whole act may have to be amended unless these people are disciplined.

Well I don't have many hobbies, as you say. I used to do a lot of fishing, trout fishing. I don't do very much of that now, and my hobbies are pretty limited. When I grow old I shall probably take up bowls, but only when I grow old.

I, I do. I'm told that I look much younger than my years, so that's not for me to say. But I think I am fairly well preserved and that there's still quite a lot of activity, mental activity in particular which I can indulge.

Yes, yes, yes, I attend the Presbyterian Church in Island Bay, here in Wellington, and I am an active elder in the Church. So I participate fully in religious life.

Well I would hardly put it that way, but at the same time I have never lost my religious faith. Although I went from religion to politics, that didn't mean that I abandoned religion. Indeed, I think that there is greater scope for religious and moral and ethical activity in politics than I found in the Church. I've never regretted the step that I took. There have been disappointments in political life, naturally one must expect that, but at the same time I think the step that I took in 1935 in standing for Parliament was the right one.
