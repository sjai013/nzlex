While we can maintain an era of high prices, we must have prosperity. But if prosperity is due to high prices, how can the Government claim credit for it? Is it entitled to claim credit for prosperity such as it is, if that prosperity is due, as ?? Sullivan says it is to high prices? But I want to ask you a more important question. If, in fact, our prosperity is due to the high prices we see for our primary products, what's going to happen if prices fall? And they have already fallen. Butter, not in New Zealand, but in London, is down in price. So is cheese, so is dried milk, so is ewe mutton and pork. And the other day you would notice that the opening sale, wool sale at Dunedin the price of fine wool was down between sixpence and tenpence a pound. Now the Government is significantly and discreetly silent about this, sir. It's had nothing to say about these falling prices. And I want to ask the Government, if our prosperity is due to high prices, and prices are already on the wane, how is the, how does the Government propose to maintain our prosperity if prices continue to fall? And we've had no answer to that one from any governments, because, including the Prime Minister himself. No sir. We claim that the National Party stands indicted before the people of this country because it has failed to carry out its election pledges, and I don't want to go through them tonight. All I want to say is that no more preposterous claim has been made by any political party than is being made by the National Party at the present time, that it has carried out its election pledges. That Party, sir, has completely failed to carry out some of the most salient points in his political program, some of the pledges that won it the treasury benches in this country in 1949 and continued in his office in 1951. It was only because people believed in those pledges that they voted for the Government. And for the Government to claim today as it is claiming, that it has maintained, it has kept its pledges to the people of this country is, as I say, one of the most preposterous claims that has ever been put before the electors of this country. We say too, the Government has failed, as it promised, to reduce living costs. My word, there is a very interesting story concerning living costs. I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but I have here some figures, and they are utterly reliable figures, and completely up to date. They apply to Auckland, and what applies to Auckland is likely to apply to most towns in New Zealand. And here are the comparative figures. I give you first of all meat. Take rolled?? veal for example, the last time the last controlled price under Labour, it was elevenpence a pound, today two and fourpence. Rump steak; the last controlled price under Labour was one and eightpence, today, three and fourpence. A sirloin was one and tuppence, now two and fourpence. Corn silverside was one and tuppence ha'penny, now two and tuppence. Loin of pork was one and fivepence, now three and fivepence. See how they have redeemed their promise, sir of reducing living costs in this country, making the pound go further, stabilising, stabilising the value of your money and your earnings? And what of groceries? I'll only mention three lines. I'll only mention three lines of groceries, but here they are. Chocolate biscuits of a certain brand were two and fivepence per pound last under control. Today, the same brand of biscuit, four and a penny a pound. Wine?? biscuits which were a shilling, now two and tuppence. A tin of apricot jam, of the same brand and size, at costs under Labour two and sevenpence, costs under National today, three and tenpence ha'penny. But what of fish? My word, there's a story. I don't know what your position is in ?? If it's any cheaper than it is in the major cities of this country, then you're a very fortunate people. But here ?? well I'm surprised. I'm surprised that you would eat fish even on Friday if it's any dearer, if it's any dearer than it is in Wellington or Auckland. But here is the Auckland price, sir. Snapper, whole snapper, the last controlled price sevenpence a pound; today one and sixpence a pound. And incidentally, the fisherman gets sixpence, provided he guts the fish. Cherokee, cherokee fillets were one and tuppence ha'penny, now two and sixpence. The fisherman, the fisherman again, the fisherman gets sixpence provided he guts it. ?? steaks were one and fivepence, now two and ninepence, and of that, of that, of that what's it in ?? 

Three and tuppence in ?? Well there you are, there you are. That shows how fortunate the people of Auckland are, at least compared to the people of ??, but it shows how unfortunate the people of New Zealand are today compared with what they were when fish was controlled as it was controlled under Labour. 

My only comment on that suggestion is that some people would say that's too good for him. Now to get back to the price of fish, sir. Sole was one and a penny ha'penny a pound under controlled, now three shillings, and the fishermen gets one and tuppence for that sole. I mention these figures, sir, and I tell you there are lots of people who are interested, plenty of others, but I mention these figures in order to demonstrate just how much prices have risen since this government became the government of this country and controls of certain prices were abandoned. I want to suggest to you, that a government which has failed to keep its pledge of maintaining the peoplesâ€™ purchasing power at a stable level, is not entitled to the continued support of the people of this country. It has failed, as I have said, to maintain the value of money. If you had one hundred pounds in your savings bank in 1949, that money today if you would ?? it, would buy sixty pounds worth of goods. Forty pounds would have been stolen from you as effectively as if it had been taken out of your pocket. Sixty pounds today compared with one hundred pounds in 1949. And I want, sir, to draw attention to some of the extravagance and waste that has been going on under this government. They said that taxation in New Zealand was too high and so they would reduce it. You know what it was in Labour's last year of office? All taxations, including social security, one hundred and thirty-five million pounds. You know what it is this year? It's been reduced. It's two hundred and fourteen million pounds. Two hundred and fourteen million pounds. But is it any wonder that taxation is high when these things are happening? Now, we had a visit from her gracious Majesty the Queen, and nobody will say that any legitimate expendage that was incurred in providing adequate hospitality for Her Majesty and those associated with her while she was here, should not have been so spent. No New Zealander will claim that. But I want to tell you this, and I think most people would find it pretty hard to justify. There were between seventy and eighty press representatives from overseas travelling with the royal party. This government decided that it would pay all their hotel expenses and all their transport charges from one end of this country to the other. They are the representatives of some of the wealthiest newspaper concerns in the world, and yet the taxpayers of this country have been called upon to pay the expenses of up to eighty representatives of the press, and I am going to say here tonight that nobody can possibly justify
