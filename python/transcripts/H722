No, I don't feel nostalgic in the slightest. Everest, you see is a great chunk of a mountain, rather ugly really as mountains go, and I think all of those who get involved on it spend so much of their time being miserable and sort of feeling nauseated or short of breath or being in incredibly squalid camps for week after week that even though one may reach the top and have a great sense of achievement and so on, I find it difficult to imagine that anybody could really have a nostalgic feeling towards the mountain. 

There's so many other mountains that are more beautiful and where one perhaps has a more relaxed and happier time on them that, no, I look on Everest still as a tremendous challenge, a foreboding peak in many ways, that still seems just about as hard to climb really as it was in our day, and it's so big and so overwhelming as far as logistics are concerned. It's not a peak you sort of pat on the head and say 'Good boy' and like it. No it's sort of almost rather, a frightening in many ways.

No, I don't quite know what you mean there, but the, I look back on the Antarctic thing more as a succession of incidents almost, rather than sort of one major sort of objective as we had with Everest. The problems are different, the problems are more ones of great distance, of logistics and of carefully working out plans the immediate dangers vary, I mean the I don't think perhaps you're in such dangerous terrain for as long as you are on a mountaineering expedition, but then you have the problem of travelling with vehicles over hundreds of miles of crevassed country and so on, which is very nerve wracking. I would, think that the Antarctic to me gave many incidents and many occasions where we had challenges and we had comradeship and where we had exciting moments and so on, but it never really did for me come together as one great sort of particular challenge.

I don't really know that it's got much to do with the question of whether they are climbers or scientists, because many people are both. And but I think it does make a difference of course, working with different types of people. The, I had, in many ways I think you've perhaps chosen the wrong two people. There are many things about Eric Shipton you see in his planning of trips which I heartily disagreed with. I always remember on one occasion, he wasn't good at, for instance organising food for an expedition, in fact because he didn't particularly like food, he didn't enjoy food, he'd eat anything that was going, so he didn't select good food.

 And in one, one of the members of the expedition was asked on the BBC as to what were the main things in organising the food, and referring to Eric's expedition he said 'Well, the main thing is there should be some', and Eric sometimes didn't have enough food, so that was a thing in which he was in my view very weak. But then he had these other aspects which were almost inspirational, in the way that he had this tremendous drive and this enthusiasm, a lot of warmth to carry his party along. Vivian Fuchs of course was quite a different type.


He didn't have the sort of warmth aspect at all, he was much more methodical, almost laborious perhaps in some of his working out of problems, and much more difficult I think to really feel, certainly me, anyway, who is a rather perhaps erratic type, I found it more difficult to be motivated perhaps by a Fuchs than I am by a Shipton. I don't think there's any question about that.

Well I suppose it's the end of a chain almost, the, on the various expeditions that I've been involved in, of course I'd had close associations with our Sherpas, and I became very very friendly indeed with quite a few of the our Sherpa porters and our climbers, and when we went down into the villages we were given hospitality in the homes of the Sherpas and so on, and we developed a considerable affection for them, and of course, living in their homes, you couldn't help but notice the perhaps the disadvantages that we would regard that they had, the lack of any education for their children, the certain amount of lack of hygiene, the no opportunity for treatment for diseases, and then even more forcibly, I suppose, for a couple of years there, there were occasions in which Sherpas I'd been very friendly with either would die suddenly, or their families would die.


 I remember one year going back, and in the house of one of the Sherpas, his child, who he'd been very proud of, who I'd sort of jogged around on my knee on this occasion, I arrived back next year and the child was dead. And obviously nothing had been possible to do about it. So in the end I think my the big step that I really made was from feeling sorry about it actually to doing something about it. And this all came about largely with talking to the Sherpas, and it suddenly seemed to me well, why in the heck wasn't I trying to do something, because the money involved was so small compared to what we regarded as was necessary to do these things. 


So that was why in 1960, 61 I raised the funds for a school in the village of ??, and we worked with the local people and in the end we established our first school up there. And this sort of thing has escalated now, we've got fourteen of these little schools all over the place, and I really feel that you more or less could go on indefinitely as long as you had the money to do it. But I think that, I don't like to feel and I'm sure it's not true, that we're doing these things in a sense of being do-gooders. I think first of all, the main thing is I never tried to inflict a school or a hospital or anything else on a village, I think it's rather, some people wander into a village and they look around and they, in their supreme arrogance they say right, well you need a school there and you need something else there and you need something else there and all the rest of it. 

Well I don't agree with this approach at all. I think you can possibly persuade people that they might be a good idea, but in general I wait until I've been approached on a number of occasions by a village asking for assistance to work on these projects. And when they have offered to contribute, the only thing they have really which is their labour free, only then do I feel that we can sort of get to grips with the problem and work with them on it, and then it is very satisfying, because we are working with the local people on a, on their own project.

Well, I think there are a lot of individuals, actually, who are making tremendous efforts to help. And a lot of these individuals are in ?? positions, sometimes they are important people in the community. I do not however feel that the, humanity as a whole, that we're really getting to grips with the problems anywhere near as enthusiastically as we could. Even in our own society there's no question still that rugby, racing, going to the beach and all the rest of it are the dominant factors in our lives. 

And although there's nothing much wrong with these things, I just suggest that perhaps we should be devoting a little bit more thought, instead of just talking about the problems in our community and the problems in the world in general. We should be devoting a little more thought, a little bit more effort and a jolly sight more money to doing something about it. You know we don't like to talk about money when we're referring to social problems and so on, as long as ?? to do it. But after all, money does represent what we can do in our community, and unless we're prepared to put out the money, and make a little bit of a sacrifice, obviously you're not going to do anything at all.

Yes, I would indeed, actually. I think that, you know to make these, my experience has been that to make substantial changes, to vow to do a substantial amount of help, it's surprising how little money you can create a change. We don't always just have to think in hundreds of millions of dollars, it's quite surprising how in a good little project, with a small amount of money, you can have a bit of an impact. 

Yes, I'm inclined to think that's true. I think that the attitudes of changing over from talking about things and deploring things to saying 'well, letâ€™s do something about it' is probably the single biggest step our society can take. Now I feel this is particularly true in New Zealand. The, we get little, almost no what I would call inspirational and motivational action from government, for instance. I think that nearly all the really good projects that have taken place from New Zealand are started by individuals. 

They get support and very good support frequently from the public, they almost invariably have the greatest of ?? in getting any support from government. I would like to think that in a country such as ours that it would be possible to have a little bit of inspiration from the top, perhaps a little bit of active assistance that wasn't expected, maybe, instead of having to have this constant battle with officialdom, to try and get financial support for what's something which everybody agrees is a worthwhile project.

Goodness alone know, actually, I suppose the only effective way in a democracy is by, is through the power of the voter. But I think in many ways it's unfortunate the way in our society that we are constantly being forced to form pressure groups in order to combat some other pressure group and get the sort of the national cake cut in a reasonable sort of a way. I am one of those who really feel it would be marvellous or and on the few occasions that we do get someone who is prepared to sort of lead the country a little bit, I think it's absolutely marvellous. I only wish we had more of it.

Well I, I do have quite a lot to do with young people and sort of having young family of my own, so I tend to get involved in it to some degree. My wife and I always say that you know you read that the teenage time is the time in which the young people really learn the most. Well we have found of course that the teenage time is when their parents really learn the most and this is, I'm not really joking, this is absolutely true. We've learnt a great deal in communication?? with young people and are still learning of course.

 I feel that the young people of today are more honest in their assessment of many of the problems, they are franker in facing up to them, it's not a different, not a easy time for people to live, I don't think, the even the affluence of our society I think can bring many problems. I admire many of our young people today. Some of them are incredibly stupid, of course but so they have always been in all ages of our society. I would like to see the change, and this is where I think perhaps the responsibility rests very much with the older generation to try and, I feel that all of us have a, have rights in society, but we also of course have responsibilities and this is I think perhaps where the older generation should try by some means to get the message home to the young people as well that they have their rights, they have the right to be heard, I think, their views to be at least sensibly considered, but I do think also that they have their responsibilities, and sort of the even protest is OK.


 But protest without the desire to contribute, to my mind is, is rather lacking in any sort of effectiveness and I think that we can get our young people with their good ideas, with their often clear thinking, I think, about many of our problems, their refusals to accept the status quo as being right because that's what we happen to have, if we can get them sufficiently motivated to get ??? and to do something, then I think we may be starting to get somewhere.

Well I don't have the slightest doubt about that really. The thing that's given me the greatest satisfaction questionably is not climbs of mountains or activities in Antarctic, it is undoubtedly my activities, as far as assistance programs are concerned particularly with the Sherpas, and I think if you know, when I sort of kick the bucket as it were, of all the things that I would really like to be kept going, the things that I'd really like to feel had some continuing activity would unquestionably be my Sherpas schools and so on.

Thank you.
