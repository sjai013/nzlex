We had, even at quite early stages, quite fierce arguments. My father was a very firm gentleman, maybe perhaps a little bit harsh at times, and I certainly, if it was a matter of disagreement used to end up in the woodshed with my father, getting thumped. In a way I think it almost became a battle of wills.


In that the main thing my father really wanted was for me to admit that I had done something wrong, where I was absolutely determined, whether I had done it wrong or not that I was not going to admit it. And in actual fact I don't think I ever did admit my, the error of my ways, rightly or wrongly. I don't think this is a necessarily a particularly worthy approach on my part, but it's perhaps showed that I


had quite a stubborn will anyway, even in those days. I must have been a very uncomfortable child, I think, for my parents.

Yes, my mother really was the more the inspirational side of our family activity. She'd been a school teacher, she was very anxious that her three children should be well educated, even though this meant a considerable drain on the family finances in years when we didn't have any finances


and I think that all we three children were very thankful of her determination that we should be well educated, even though my father frequently said 'Oh, we simply can't afford to send so and so to such and such a school, it'd be much better if he came home and worked and helped with the getting of food and all the rest of it'. But my mother, who was a much quieter person but who will prevailed in these things, and all of us ended up by going to reasonable education


Yes, I was sort of the child genius of the ?? Primary school. I think because my mother was a schoolteacher she sort of pumped me full of I wouldâ€™ve thought rather useless information, but I did have a lot of general information. And the teachers at ?? Primary school sort of liked teaching me, because I could absorb it relatively easily


So instead of completing ?? Primary school at the average age of thirteen, I passed at the age of eleven. And with great determination from my mother, who was determined I was going to go to a good school in Auckland, we lived forty miles out in ??, I went to Auckland Grammar. I was a very unhappy child at Auckland Grammar. It really had nothing to do with Auckland Grammar, I think I would have been inevitably unhappy all through my


secondary school period, one reason being that being much younger than the average in the school, I felt I was small, I was sort of rather helpless, I came from a country school, even at primary school I had learnt nothing about things like French, or even any advanced sort of mathematics. So I was thrust into this rather more high-powered environment in Auckland Grammar


and for a while I really found it quite a struggle. But when I look back on it, I really didn't do too badly at Auckland Grammar. I certainly wasn't one of the bright students, I was just a very mediocre one. But I did end up getting my matriculation, and university entrance, so I couldn't have been a no-hoper anyway.


Yeah, well I mean because I was very young, I was much smaller than the average child in my class. But I think it probably when I was in about the fourth form, or maybe the fifth form, I suddenly started growing, and I grew six inches in one year and five inches in the next year. And so towards the end of my time at Grammar, I was definitely one of the larger boys there. And so this sort of changed my attitude physically, anyway, and I also knew by that time that


I was physically energetic, and robust, and every spare moment away from school I was working with my father in the bees doing hard physical labour. It's why I think that I, by the end of the school period, I was, I was a physically strong person, not particularly good athletically, but just physically robust.


Now this actually affected and still affects really the whole of my attitude to life.

It was, it was when I first went to Grammar and we all had to go along to the gymnasium really to be assessed for training and what procedures would be carried out on us. And this gymnastics instructor, who I regard as one of the more unpleasant teachers that I ever had anything to do with


when we stripped off sort of business, and he looked at me and I can clearly remember him looking at me with scorn and saying to me 'What will they send to me next', and he told me that I had bulging rib cages and my back wasn't very straight, and he just about told me everything that was terrible about my physical set-up. Now this created in me


I mean I was absolutely mortified, of course. And this created in me an enormous sense of inferiority, which even although I have developed into a somewhat large and robust person, I still retain, and personally still retain, I still think I'm a rather strange looking character, and even though I know you know, I'm reasonably normal, except rather large.

I think actually that this initial approach built up


even in those early days, and remember I was only eleven at that stage, I built up a determination to be reasonably competent physically in some form or another. Because of the fact that I, for three and a half years I travelled by train every day from ?? to Auckland Grammar and back again which meant virtually four hours a day I was on the train. I wasn't really able to take parts in much sports and


as a consequence, really I had to entertain myself in the physical way, so I did a tremendous amount of walking and rushing around over the fields and jumping over fences and so on, and I think I got reasonably fit and certainly active in that fashion. But towards my later days at high school and early days at university, I sort of took lessons in jujitsu and boxing, and


I remember one occasion was in the Auckland gymnasium I think it was in those days, while I was taking boxing lessons. And the New Zealand welterweight professional champion, a very strong looking gentleman, also trained in this particular place. Now I was by then larger than he was and with a great deal longer reach, and the gentleman who ran the museum, he asked amongst us if some of us would like to do a bit of sparring to, with the, this professional boxer


now just you know so he could get experience and practice and all the rest of it. Well I said 'Yeah, why not', you know he didn't look all that tough to me sort of business. So we went into the ring and he, we sparred around a bit and he was obviously infinitely stronger and much more adept that I was, but he was a little bit careless and he dropped his guard, and I had a rather good straight left, and I reached out and I whanged him good and properly on the nose.


Now I discovered that it really isn't a good idea to hit a very tough professional boxer on the nose very firmly. He absolutely lost his temper and he laid into me and finally delivered a most tremendous uppercut to my solar plexus and I doubled up and that was the end of that little episode for me. And the instructor kept saying to me 'You silly boy


Why did you punch him on the nose?' Well I mean I thought that was what I was supposed to do, but I discovered that was not a wise thing to do to a professional boxer.

Yes indeed.

I think I, yes, I didn't deliberately want to be a loner, but because of the, the life I was leading, and the fact that I was constantly, really didn't have much to do with the kids at school because I was going back home to ?? all the time


I did build up a few friendships with the young people on the train, who were also travelling distances, but I travelled further than everybody else, so I suppose in a way I didn't have the social relationships which people tend to build up at their secondary school level. So I really left Auckland Grammar without you know, a real friend in the world, I'd have said.


Yes my parents I would have said were, had, what I would call firm, they were very supportive of the Church of England, and but were not exactly what I would have said were deeply religious people. My father got involved in the administration


of the church in ??, sufficiently so that he was one of the lay representatives who used to go to the meetings of the?? in Auckland. And he was always a great organiser and a great enthusiast on principles and all the rest of it, so he was a strong person in that respect. So we children all went along to church regularly. I never felt


tremendously motivated by it, but it was more or less a thing to do. However our, I always remember that at one stage we were passed through a series of courses by the local minister so that we could be confirmed. And the Bishop was going to come out, so it was going to be a big deal. But anyway, this minister was a very great enthusiast for his religion and I think he got a little bit carried away


in that he absolutely convinced me, anyway, that when I was confirmed in the church I would undoubtedly receive the Holy Ghost. Now I didn't quite know what the Holy Ghost was, but obviously it was going to completely change my life. And so on the day of the confirmation I went along to Church full of anticipation of a change in the rather mediocre person I regarded myself as.


and I duly went through the confirmation ceremony, which was very nicely handled by the bishop and all the rest of it and then I came away from the church and I suddenly realised that I wasn't any different. I wasn't nobler, I didn't have any greater powers, I really wasn't any different from what I'd been before. And I think that was when my first doubts about the whole, the system tended to be eroded more than somewhat. I did pass through a phase in which I
