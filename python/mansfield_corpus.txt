Each guest who came into the breakfast-room was bombarded with the wonderful news.
The gentlemen wore black coats, white silk ties and ferny buttonholes tickling the chin.
Myself, I felt disappointed that there was not a salute of twenty-five guns.
Did the spirit of romance spread her rose wings only over aristocratic Germany.
I suppose the searching after Fraulein Schafer doesn't occupy all your days.
Nine verses equally lovely commanded her to equally violent action.
Warm the teapot, interrupted the Herr Rat, pushing away his soup plate.
As for me, I have had all I wanted from women without marriage.
But a dumb niece with unwashed ears struck me as a most depressing object.
Living with her I live with the coffin of my unborn aspirations.
Cheer up, old woman, shouted her husband, digging her in the ribs.
At nine I drank some malt coffee, and began my cure.
By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue.
They all looked at me, shaking their heads, their mouths full of cherry stones.
You're rotten to the core and so am I. But you're heathenishly beautiful.
The piano was closed, an arm-chair was placed in the centre of the platform.
There were even rich buds unfolding, and the leaves shone like oil.
He measured a good washstand pitcher in height, and I smiled.
Some little sparrows, young sparrows they sounded, chirped on the window-ledge.
She snarled, and swooping over she fastened her teeth in his glove.
But she has no right to let her daughters wear such short sailor suits.
A great bush of purple lilac grew behind the summer-house.
We gorged on scandals of High Birth generously buttered.
I've been reading all about your English play in a newspaper.
All the ladies eat, too, especially the ladies.
Every Sunday morning Ethel would read aloud while Ma Parker did her washing.
Heaven knows what infectious disease may be breeding now in that boot.
And then in the rocky gateway the shepherd himself appeared.
Even for the most jaded of us life holds its thrilling moments.
The piles of dirty cups, dirty dishes, were washed and dried.
Why did the photographs of dead people always fade so.
Fastidiously, his lips curling, Andreas picked his way through the water.
The poet from Munich never took his eyes off the pair.
But I was exceedingly nice, a trifle diffident, appropriately reverential.
A nice shake-up in the bus never improved his appetite.
Thought Viola, and looking at him again he did not seem quite so jolly.
He wore a very shabby dressing-gown and carried a crumpled newspaper in one hand.
She said, horrified, however are we going to stop everything.
Stanley was half-way up the path before he saw Linda.
And in a vacant chair beside him he placed a little black leather bag.
All the Exhibitions, all the Art and Soul life of Germany are in Munchen.
The servant brought in veal, with sauerkraut and potatoes.
He put his face into her bosom and his arms enfolded her.
The Samuel Josephs never played by themselves or managed their own game.
The Professor drew in his feet and sat up sharply, pulling down his waistcoat.
She came to my bedroom and offered to massage my arm.
Now, there is something peculiarly intimate in sharing an umbrella.
Ah, that's one thing I can do, said I, laughing brightly.
And just look at this nougat, he cried ecstatically, just look at it.
Joce, the butterfly, always came down in a silk petticoat and a kimono jacket.
He looked as though he could order a magnificent dinner.
A tall young girl got out, leading a child by the hand.
They wiped their forks upon black bread and started again.
To her relief grandma seemed no longer sad.
On his lap there lay a beautiful pale yellow silk handkerchief.
There were no white dunes covered with reddish grass beyond them.
He looked down at the row of garden strips and backyards.
He also forsook work, and stood by the window, picking his nose.
A young girl scratched a lullaby on a young fiddle.
In Austria even the cabmen have serviettes.
She dipped a piece of sugar in her coffee and watched it dissolve.
That made the student from Bonn sit up.
I order double portions, and eat them in peace.
We shan't be able to hear each other speak.
From the hollow class-rooms came a quick drumming of voices.
She had meant to have fish mayonnaise for lunch and now.
But she'd never heard his name until she saw it on the theatres.
Go on now, clear out.
I think he's a little gone here, tapping her forehead.
Sometimes I think the solution lies in marriage, said Fraulein Sonia.
And the carpet we made ourselves out of old clothes.
They entered the hall, were greeted and shown to their room.
I suppose you are frightened of an invasion, too, eh.
I must be back in London in September.
The dishes were changed for beef, red currants and spinach.
You will marry a red-haired man and have three children.
I've left them at the hotel for you to digest later on.
She would like to have kept those wisps as a keepsake, as a remembrance.
Isabel, we're all going for a bathe.
He's only staying until tomorrow evening.
The icy wind blew out her apron into a balloon.
I think I prefer both equally well.
Nurse Andrews had, of course, jumped at the idea.
Four men in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the garden path.
She breathed in a small whisper to the boy, Hallo, my funny.
Thundered the greybeard, with pristine freshness.
My insides are all twisted up with having children too quickly.
A delicate woman, volunteered the Hungarian, but pleasant.
Do you know that poem of Sappho about her hands in the stars.
My peaceful attitude of mind towards it is completely destroyed.
Psychologically I understood your refusal.
Not even an efficient waiter can you have by yourselves.
'Ah, will you to a convent fly, So young, so fresh, so fair.
When the door was closed we raised a triumphant cry.
Oh, what a loathsome thing to have done.
I think its up to Moira to use her little arts and wiles.
Our client moreover is positive.
She turned away from the Buddha with one of her vague gestures.
But it was most unfortunate.
But it all seemed blurred, unreal, like a picture in the newspaper.
Why is it so exciting to be awake when everybody else is asleep.
Heaven reward thy sweet patience, lady mine, he murmured.
What are you looking at, my grandma.
But Lottie always makes a floating island, don't you, Lottie.
Ignorance must not go uncontradicted.
And so large that I can go down there and walk about.
Her loud, slightly harsh voice filled the salon.
It is beautiful enough to hang from a watch-chain.
She asked, leaning her arms on the table and pillowing her breast against them.
Which resolution comforted her absolutely.
Young blood, answered the Herr Rat genially.
Naturally, absent from home one must expect much discomfort and strange food.
Poverty-stricken, her limbs with tattered rags half covered.
Each year I come expecting to find you with an empty nest.
Frau Hartmann, I congratulate you.
I chewed a leaf and hugged my knees.
They sway and languish dreamily, And we, close pressed, are kissing there.
She very obviously followed the advice.
Somehow or other he managed to shake some sort of smile at her.
He flung his hat on to the huge bed and went towards her.
The straw basket of programmes was tossed from arm to arm.
Peering through that round eye she could see far off some rocks.
I saw a beautiful umbrella broken in half like that on my way over.
A Lady with a Box of Sardines, said Dennis gravely.
She was sitting in the open taxi outside.
I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of cocoa in the tin.
The result looked like a gigantic dustbin.
I say, he cried, there's an English bulldog.
There's some marmalade in the sideboard.
Must they be hidden by a marquee.
It was muffled as though the dog had its head in a sack.
Draw up your chair, my dear, said Mrs. Stubbs, beginning to pour out.
The bell jangled, the red serge curtains parted, and Mrs. Stubbs appeared.
Pity to have made herself so conspicuous.
Yes, that was her real grudge against life.
Linda saw that river, very wide, covered with little rafts and boats.
She was a long, strange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet.
First man in as usual.
Big twists and curls jostled and shouldered each other as the silvery beams broadened.
How could the poor darling help not having any money.
I'd far rather you loved other things, said the strange man slowly.
She is the incarnation of comprehending Love.
After all, dash it, they were young still.
He'd take her away and they'd loaf about together somewhere.
Two stone heavier than I, if he's a pound, thought Andreas.
It doesn't matter, they're all busy upstairs.
Lights were turned on immediately the cafe opened, and business was very brisk.
His red face was covered with pimples, and his nails indescribably filthy.
Would you come with me as far as the railway station and back.
And retired, the very young gentleman dodging her train and scowling.
It is a great pity that the English nation is so unmusical.
But doubtless they have not the same symbolical value for the English.
The quantity of fruit I have eaten on this bench, he sighed.
That is almost a mouthful in itself.
Or perhaps you do not care to eat the worms.
You go into the bedroom and fetch my blue silk handkerchief.
Nothing rested him so much then as for me to stroke his head.
Dear Frau Fischer, won't you take your coffee out in the garden.
Four of the clock one July afternoon she appeared at the Pension Muller.
But they are beautifully kept, said the sister of the Baroness shyly.
But she graciously suffered our worship and we were more than content.
I found myself pitying the Baron.
There you are, I said.
No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and such lips.
Ah, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far.
Harold hadn't come back from lunch until close on four.
The corridors were silent and cold.
No, she said, I won't go outside.
How strange she'd never thought of it like that before.
They sat outside the house in long chairs under coloured parasols.
We shall have to anoint ourselves with butter, said Dennis.
He touched her cool hand, her cool cheek.
It would frighten Ethel out of her life.
She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too.
But it was a charming air.
She put the big, frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass.
When a faint violin sounded she winced and bit her lip again.
Calm yourself, she said superbly.
How wrong, how wicked, feeling as I do.
He tried to smile, to say I'm glad.
It is to-morrow that you're going, isn't it.
But his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost immediately.
It was thirty-five years old.
But at that moment in the street below a barrel-organ struck up.
They're such awfully nice men.
The very idea made one shudder.
I've got the names somewhere on the back of an envelope.
She had no idea that he was grey.
That's a more intolerable situation than the other.
But Jonathan only answered, A little love, a little kindness.
She hated her grandma to be sad.
He could not be disloyal.
And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour.
They were the Trout boys, Pip and Rags.
No time to say good-bye.
You haven't been using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance.
Their cry sounded in the dreams of little children.
And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist.
Then something immense came into view.
Why, even a prostitute has a greater sense of generosity.
He paused by the window and glanced at her a moment over his shoulder.
What does the pussy cat do all day.
I just saw her go out to buy some.
They had looked at each other, stunned with the conflict and sympathised.
I know no such name in a sharp voice.
You look like a little boy with your hair blowing about in the wind.
Oh, what a beautiful, noble idea.
As you please, said the landlord, obviously scorning us.
But by that time she had to peg out the washing for the Frau.
Shouted Hans, hitting Anton over the head with his empty cup.
She's got twice the nerve of you and me rolled into one.
He wore an immense geranium flower stuck in the lapel of his coat.
Straightway Andreas felt that he was being accused.
From the pine forest streamed a wild perfume, the branches swayed together, rhythmically, sonorously.
Then you are an Englishwoman.
Oh, I spend the day here now, she answered.
What a fire, she shrieked, stretching out her hands.
Oh, mamma, please don't say such things, Sonia flushed and grew very angry.
Such a brilliant way of putting things.
This is my little English friend of whom I have spoken.
Such a clout on the ear as you gave me.
Her roughened hands clasped and unclasped themselves in the folds of her skirt.
That's not how a wedding should be, she said.
You must tuck the ends into your boots until we get there.
But I consider child-bearing the most ignominious of all professions, I said.
I said he was a sea-captain on a long and perilous voyage.
When I meet new people I squeeze them dry like a sponge.
A chestnut tree pushed green boughs against the window.
I am not accustomed to such company.
He and Frau Fischer were old friends.
You do not seem to enjoy discussing the functions of the body.
Her high-born reply was what interested me.
Youth should be like a wild rose.
Coffee and rolls took on the nature of an orgy.
Afflicted children have such pretty ways.
I really do not know, I answered.
I assure you we are not afraid.
How long are you remaining here.
Who ever heard of having children upon vegetables.
I have not eaten meat for three years.
My lady put me into collars and cuffs from the first.
They were ever so kind to me.
Come along, I'd say, come along, and I'll lay out your patience for you.
But it's always boiling before my lady is half through.
She looked at Ethel over her spectacles.
The carriage gates were pushed back.
They are hard to resist.
They are eagerly bought by the soldiers.
She lay on his breast, but so lightly, so remotely.
He bent over her and she looked up with her familiar half-smile.
His heart was wrung with such a spasm that he could have cried out.
He was something between the sheep-dog and the shepherd.
As much expression as you can put into it.
The willow trees, outside the high, narrow windows, waved in the wind.
She didn't even recognise him again.
And when Leila compared him with her other partners he looked shabby.
It gave her quite a shock again to see how old he was.
Drawled a faint voice close to her ear.
Meg passed him on to Leila.
There was a joyful flutter among the girls.
Strange voices answered, Of course, my dear.
It must have had a knock, somehow.
One golden hour set with sixty diamond minutes.
There, lying to one side on an immense bed, lay grandpa.
But grandma remembered too, at the same time.
Such a very nice stewardess came to meet them.
Grandma made a small, astonished face.
He clasped grandma in his arms and pressed her to him.
Beside him her grandma bustled along in her crackling black ulster.
Look here, said William, how are we going to sit.
May thy head, William, lack not ointment.
You think they are another bad sign.
We are inclined to reconsider.
Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed.
Ma Parker gave no answer.
Will you stay in the car while I go and look.
And then we were outside again.
I sipped my tea, leaned back, and even asked if I might smoke.
Oh well, there seems nowhere else, said she.
How can you talk of cutting off now.
Oh, if you only knew how horrid I feel.
And where are you going, if your mother may ask.
It was the shadow from the tree outside.
Well, we can't postpone it again, said Josephine.
Oh, eggs in various forms.
And this time, said Josephine firmly, we must come to a definite decision.
She raised her pale eyebrows until they rippled away into her pale hair.
Asked Josephine, trying to begin to concentrate.
I'm afraid I shan't be able to stay very long with grandfather.
But we mustn't let you off with that.
It would be somehow so satisfactory.
The cab was dreadfully stuffy.
She heard his stick thumping.
We can't disturb Kate again, she said softly.
A spasm of pity squeezed her heart.
He was given up to his dream.
Run down just as you are.
And somehow that seemed quite the best plan.
Mrs. Sheridan got up and came over to her, carrying the hat.
What's given you such a colour.
Jose began to be seriously annoyed.
But still one must go everywhere.
Sadie had her hand clapped to her cheek as though she had toothache.
She looked mournfully and enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.
Let's try over 'This life is Weary.'
But at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them.
It was the heavy piano being moved on its stiff castors.
How very nice workmen were.
But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men.
You enjoy yourself while you're young.
Let us live our life, all new, all ours, from the very beginning.
My very own for ever.
Oh, what a joy it is to own things.
I've had the hell of a day.
He leapt across the flower-bed and seized her in his arms.
I must go seek those heirs to my fame and fortune.
No guiding principle, let us call it.
I'm exactly like that insect again.
Why don't I fly out again.
He was always full of new ideas, schemes, plans.
Would ye have me laugh, my fair sister.
It must be awful, she said slowly.
Greeting, my Celestial Peach Blossom.
The gorgeous sunset had blazed and died.
Whatever did we shut the door for.
Alice did wish there'd been a bit of life on the road though.
I never seen anyone so eaten.
But still her grandma was silent.
Grandma, she said in a startled voice.
And how strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot sun.
We know all about that.
But she checked herself and said to the boy coldly, I don't like babies.
The boy had turned over.
And she gave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at the other women.
Of course there were stories, but such stories.
He ignored his wife just as she ignored him.
But aren't you going to bathe here.
Then the children were unbuttoned.
This one was as big as a star and far more beautiful.
The little girls ran into the paddock like chickens let out of a coop.
There was no man to disturb them.
Their very voices were changed as they called to one another.
Why can't you eat your food properly like Isabel and Lottie.
She smiled, and a look of deep content shone in her eyes.
He only woke up once last night.
They settled themselves on the bench opposite Stanley and Beryl.
They were dressed alike in blue jerseys and knickers.
As Stanley helped himself his blue eyes widened.
This mania for conversation irritated Stanley beyond words.
But Jonathan was a match for him.
The same soaking bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy palings.
There was nothing to mark which was beach and where was the sea.
The garden party by Katherine Mansfield
I sent him home to change his clothes.
She struggled, and was quite amazed to realise how angry she felt.
Yes, I'm not busy tomorrow, she said.
Was it possible that the strange man was still there?.
That was the life for her.
Well, that had been a fascinating interlude.
Drops of water fell from her hair on to the paper.
No, she's not living here, answered Viola.
Eight kilometres it must be.
From the road a sudden shout of triumph.
My dear little lady, you must not take the quotation literally.
What is it your Shakespeare says.
Oh, because they live close to the earth, and therefore despise it.
Rather, under the lying garb of false masculinity.
What right have they even to question each other.
Fritz escaped that truly Christian trap by saying, I asked you first.
Being interpreted, it meant single file, which was distressing for Elsa and Fritz.
We marched en masse along the station road.
Da, that child has such energy.
Allow me to introduce you to each other.
Yes, nodding graciously to the Advanced Lady.
The Frau Professor is going to be one of us for the afternoon.
Shall we join the others.
They only received the letters of blessing from their parents yesterday morning.
For us, she said, there will be a double joy.
You'll not cry any more or wake up in the night.
Such great big black trees on either side.
Once upon a time she was walking along a little white road, with oh.
There was a little piece of candle burning in the enamel bracket.
They were laughing and holding each other by the hand.
Standing on tiptoe in the yard, she almost felt she would be blown away.
That's why I'm not awake.
Don't guzzle it yourself or I'll know.
Well, she's hooked a boy this time.
He'd have to force her out of it, that's all.
He began to plan a little trip for them.
Well, once this boy business was over she'd get stronger.
She certainly was a little thing.
They stirred something in him, those bells, something vague and tender.
Asked Andreas, loathing the man.
No time to indulge in pernicious little habits.
He took up a book, and wheeled his arm-chair over to the window.
The doctor whistled a little tune and flicked the mare again.
Tell me on the way up.
On Sunday a man has the right to expect his family.
It's partly the effect of Sunday.
Two dogs sprawled in the middle of the road, scuffling and biting.
The gutters were choked with the leavings of Saturday night.
But the Master gave her no opening.
She was full of terrified joy and importance in the goings on upstairs.
I suppose I'd better not disturb her.
There was a gentle knock at the door and his mother came in.
He repeated it quickly several times, with a snapping movement of the jaws.
What are you going to do this afternoon, Fraulein Anna.
Fancy, she has a separate plate for each of her front teeth.
She turned round and leaned on one elbow.
It makes such a pleasant excursion for a fine Saturday afternoon.
A high wooden wall compasses us all about.
I think it must be the umbrellas which make us look ridiculous.
Here was someone beside her laughing, too.
But the outer door suddenly opening, she sprang to her feet and laughed.
She brushed out her long hair and gathered it in her hands.
Well, you are a funny one, she said.
You go downstairs, leave me alone.
Sabina took on the extra work without any thought of extra pay.
It meant an extra half-hour in bed for her.
And I do not see any possible light out of this darkness.
But what a bother, said I.
Thus the modern soul and I found ourselves together under the stars.
My spirit starves for want of that.
He was off duty and intended to show it.
Then, presumably, the winged shaft struck her collar brooch.
Yes, I know you have no love for me, And no forget-me-not.
What do you intend to recite, Fraulein Sonia.
I forget nothing, mamma, answered Sonia.
My lamented husband, your father, Sonia, knew a great deal about England.
But the tragedy of the story is this:
The conversation is not out of your depth.
I have been making music for them on my trombone.
The children were all soundly sleeping.
God, the trouble you gave me.
He tilted back in his chair, chuckling with laughter.
It's not religion to love two men.
He was a traveller, and only stayed at their house two nights.
He winked at the guests, who broke into loud laughter.
It was easier when they came into the village.
So young and yet to suffer so cruelly, she murmured.
Then, dear child, where is your husband.
You look like a little Persian kitten.
That is a very nice idea.
There is a piece of that beautiful flannel petticoat you left us last summer.
The washstand has, of course, been scrubbed over with soda.
Are there many people here just now.
How you keep them all I don't know.
Bertha, turning to the youngest of the five, how changed.
And the greetings were so long and loud that I felt a sympathetic glow.
How I should adore to kiss you, murmured the student.
Was love then a question of manicure.
I pricked up my ears.
She sighed and turned up her eyes.
And, fancy now, she has already had six proposals of marriage.
I have written these lines:
He fixed a stony eye on her, and she blushed.
Such reserve, such a tender way with the child.
To my plebeian eyes that afflicted child was singularly unattractive.
The manager immediately left the room to find a new nib.
But the child is dumb, ventured the manager apologetically.
There was a picture of her only last week in 'Sport and Salon.'
I have only received the letter acquainting me with the fact this morning.
When we arrived at the pension there was very nearly an open riot.
A wise idea, I answered.
I fear, he said, that my luggage will be damp.
But he himself volunteered some information.
Together we walked through the mud and slush.
Who could tell what the Future held.
Followed a complete and deathlike silence.
Suddenly the door opened and admitted the Baron.
Never had I seen him at the Casino or the Bath Establishment.
At the end of the meal we were served with coffee.
There was a lady from the Spanish Court here in the summer.
I closed the door after me.
But you cannot be in earnest.
This morning I took a half bath.
Of course she was very proud.
I can make very good tea.
Do they really eat so much.
Nothing at all, cried Herr Hoffmann from Berlin.
There he goes again, thought Andreas, airing off his knowledge.
Oil lamps, hanging from the ceiling, shed a warm, bright light.
I don't know how far I didn't run.
The little dressing-table and mirror at the far end.
A bell sounded far over the water.
Stanley lifted up to see a dark head bobbing far out and an arm lifted.
I've had my Easter lilies with a gorgeous star.
Some dreadful man tried to kiss her at the club ball.
It had been a rule for years never to disturb father in the morning
I imbibe nourishment in my room
They took it for granted it was your job to slave away for them.
I too know of much joy.
But in the afternoon six or seven choice spirits played cards.
Not to have cared enough to scratch out that word disgust.
He too felt his bathe was spoilt.
The other grasped a beautifully smooth yellow stick.
The soft swish of the sea at full tide sweeping the pebbles.
Breathless, half-choking, she told the dreadful story.
Clasping the old fish bag that held her cleaning things.
You might have seen a big fish flicking in at the window and gone again.
And quite big girls, older than me, even, were riding them.
That looked at low tide like shaggy beasts come down to the water to drink.
She saw her great big shadow on the wall.
The thing to do was to let Casimir go on his wild-goose chase.
The second bell's rung, she urged, knowing perfectly well she was telling a story.
I wonder if any air enters by the ears.
Wasn't there anywhere in the world where she could have her cry out.
When I was their age I used to go to bed hugging an old towel with a knot in it.
With little red saddles and blue bridles and bells jing-a-jingling on their ears.
Another queer thing about it was, Reggie had an idea.
Laughing, sneering, jeering, stretching out their hands while she read them William's letter.
A whole pound of butter, and such a large johnny cake that it looked like an advertisement for somebody's baking-powder.
We could manage our own food.
The three little girls appeared, each carrying a porridge plate.
A large red watering-can on the other.
It is a very strange thing, but whenever I am in the company of newly-engaged couples I blossom.
One bird drifted high like a dark fleck in a jewel.
You sit down on the side of your bed, change your shoes and dash out again.
Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usual.
And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights.
Walking on again, with her little air of remoteness.
Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room.
How handsome he had looked in that bright blue suit
To raise enthusiasm in the heart of the average British husband.
Two very handsome wreaths sent me by my first husband's brother.
His blue uniform shining with an enthusiasm which nothing but official buttons could possibly possess.
Death spasms of his Odes to Solitude.
Counting up the missing buttons on my husband's uniform jacket.
The golden-eyed marigold glittered.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am an auctioneer by profession.
Get up and light the oven or I'll shake every bone out of your body.
Reginald saw the garden open to the light.
She even thought for a moment of hiding the watch.
A dark porch, half hidden by a passion-vine.
And it's not very sympathetic to spoil everybody's enjoyment as you're doing now.
He would have taken a taxi off to a decent toyshop.
I'll get the office boy to drop in and fix it.
She tossed the boy up and said a-goos-a-goos-a-ga.
I have so seldom the time or opportunity to open my heart to a woman.
I am making my own cure, and living entirely on raw vegetables and nuts.
I was admitted into the enclosure for the first time.
The Frau got out of bed, walked in a determined fashion into the kitchen.
Looking at the strange man with a mysterious, voluptuous glance.
I can't help seeking admiration any more than a cat can help going to people to be stroked.
He had a little flower-shop just down the road.
To leap and pirouette on the parched lawn.
She wanted to push him out of the room and slam the door on him.
Quick as a flash she remembered childish parties when they had played charades.
Immersed in those wells of English thought.
Godber's has come, announced Sadie, issuing out of the pantry.
I wish you'd cut down to the gate and stop the coach.
While Isabel's precious friends didn't hesitate to help themselves.
A meringue stuffed with chestnut and a tiny horn filled with fresh strawberries.
Then the corners of her mouth dropped and her skin puckered.
Then poured the coffee from the earthenware jug into the saucepan
Get up, cried the child, speaking in a voice of immense authority.
An expression which suggested a thousand premeditated invasions.
It wasn't to come upon a sheep with three legs.
At the end of the sixth verse I saw from the window the sister of the Baroness.
He was the son of the butcher.
One requires so little, for servants are untrustworthy.
Sitting on the gatepost, far too early as usual.
But it flew up and the cord flew after.
Walking through air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like water.
Running with an impudent smile.
Her whole time was spent in rescuing him.
The humiliation of it,I adore you.
And Miss Brill smoothed the newspaper as though it were the manuscript of her part.
Nudging each other in a way that is peculiarly trying to a debutante.
They stand, as close up to the musicians as they can get.
They are usurping the privileges of their betters and wisers.
For then it is impossible for her to accept the attention of others.
Harold sauntered in, perfectly turned out as usual, cool, suave, smiling that peculiar little half-smile.
The little squat hand, with a brass-and-turquoise ring, forces the reluctant flute.
Rosa dragged it off her mother's shoulders and wound it carefully round her own.
I want passion, and love, and adventure, I yearn for them.
When I look back on my early years.
That was hilarious watching people listening to tv, because of the dub thing.
This is a doily.
I was much smaller than the average child in my class.
They are in the academic field and the educational field.
There is quite a strong and influential body of opinion.
There's not the same enthusiasm for it.
My association goes back even earlier than you mentioned in your preamble.
We guzzle up four dozen oysters and don't think about these blokes.
I enjoy just sort of bashing around and driving myself.
But protest without the desire to contribute, is rather lacking in any sort of effectiveness.
We pay thirty cents a dozen for oysters.
Now after all, the present numbers of the present government party are forty four.
He was the epitome of the phrase 'an English gentleman'.
She was very anxious that her three children should be well educated.
Three people from the national executive of the Party make the choice.
He didn't even have those oysters.
It will be extremely short on food and fuel.
This is an assumption easy to demonstrate.
My teabag thickens only when the water is warm enough.
I saw a cigar unbelievably long.
He prefers taking a bath after doing push-ups.
The iceberg vanished when we got closer.
The pink blossom touching the green leaves.
She was holding a little umbrella.
This company developed a planned toy obsolescence to make more profits.
We are facing a slow urbanisation process of this city.
Zinc has a very strange molecular configuration.
This bar gathered more customers than the little alehouse across the street.
The barber entertains the red-bearded man with a grey ape.
The Dutch abolished intra-urban traffic.
The fisher ate rice to cure his new ache.
He got a scar eight times the size of his thumb because of the troublesome obstacle.
This place is too far although with cheaper oil I would have gone there.
The shy eating patient was waiting for his scanner outside the room.
She drank the whole jar after she thought she had seen the forgiving angel.
I saw the weirdest car advert mentioning the price of the fuel.
You will find both objects in the path after the fence.
A proper traveller airport should provide a good luggage organisation.
The movie we watched for our action evening was a little odd.
The consumption age has overcome the slow ancient barter system.
I found a new odd recipe of bread but it requires a special sort of yeast.
I learnt how to play the guitar easily.
I just walked past a dry eerie district.
The guerilla era is over, let's be friends.
Each guest who came into the breakfast-room was bombarded with the wonderful news. 
The gentlemen wore black coats, white silk ties and ferny buttonholes tickling the chin. 
Myself, I felt disappointed that there was not a salute of twenty-five guns. 
Did the spirit of romance spread her rose wings only over aristocratic Germany. 
Nine verses equally lovely commanded her to equally violent action. 
As for me, I have had all I wanted from women without marriage. 
He measured a good washstand pitcher in height, and I smiled. 
Ah, will you to a convent fly, So young, so fresh, so fair. 
Warm the teapot, interrupted the Herr Rat, pushing away his soup plate. 
Jose, the butterfly, always came down in a silk petticoat and a kimono jacket. 
But a dumb niece with unwashed ears struck me as a most depressing object. 
But she graciously suffered our worship and we were more than content. 
By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue. 
They all looked at me, shaking their heads, their mouths full of cherry stones. 
Cheer up, old woman, shouted her husband, digging her in the ribs. 
Heaven knows what infectious disease may be breeding now in that boot. 
The piano was closed, an arm-chair was placed in the centre of the platform. 
But I was exceedingly nice, a trifle diffident, appropriately reverential. 
Sometimes I think the solution lies in marriage, said Fraulein Sonia. 
Living with her I live with the coffin of my unborn aspirations. 
At nine I drank some malt coffee, and began my 'cure.'
On his lap there lay a beautiful pale yellow silk handkerchief. 
a young girl scratched a lullaby on a young fiddle. 
The dishes were changed for beef, red currants and spinach. 
there were no white dunes covered with reddish grass beyond them. 
Do you know that poem of Sappho about her hands in the stars... 
The servant brought in veal, with sauerkraut and potatoes. 
All the ladies eat, too, especially the ladies. 
Every Sunday morning Ethel would read aloud while Ma Parker did her washing. 
The piles of dirty cups, dirty dishes, were washed and dried. 
But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men. 
Even for the most jaded of us life holds its thrilling moments. 
a nice shake-up in the bus never improved his appetite. 
Nurse Andrews had, of course, jumped at the idea. 
Sadie had her hand clapped to her cheek as though she had toothache. 
Four of the clock one July afternoon she appeared at the Pension Muller. 
A great bush of purple lilac grew behind the summer-house. 
thought Viola, and looking at him again he did not seem quite so jolly. 
All the exhibitions, all the art and soul of life of Germany are in Munchen. 
The waves swelled up along the breakwater and were whipped with broken foam. 
How can we hope to understand anybody, knowing nothing of their stomachs. 
You have not seen Germany if you have not been to Munchen. 
He put his face into her bosom and his arms enfolded her. 
He was something between the sheep-dog and the shepherd. 
Stanley was half-way up the path before he saw Linda. 
I know no such name in a sharp voice. 
there were even rich buds unfolding, and the leaves shone like oil. 
Her roughened hands clasped and unclasped themselves in the folds of her skirt. 
She dipped a piece of sugar in her coffee and watched it dissolve. 
and in a vacant chair beside him he placed a little black leather bag. 
asked Josephine, trying to begin to concentrate. 
the nasturtiums wreathed the veranda poles in green and gold flame. 
Coffee and rolls took on the nature of an orgy. 
You will marry a red-haired man and have three children. 
But his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost immediately. 
Some little sparrows, young sparrows they sounded, chirped on the window-ledge. 
she said, horrified, however are we going to stop everything. 
he looked down at the row of garden strips and backyards. 
A delicate woman, volunteered the Hungarian, but pleasant. 
It is a great pity that the English nation is so unmusical. 
You go into the bedroom and fetch my blue silk handkerchief. 
You do not seem to enjoy discussing the functions of the body. 
She had meant to have fish mayonnaise for lunch and now... 
I think I prefer both equally well... 
He looked as though he could order a magnificent dinner. 
But she has no right to let her daughters wear such short sailor suits. 
Psychologically I understood your refusal. 
How I should adore to kiss you, murmured the student. 
But they are beautifully kept, said the sister of the Baroness shyly. 
They entered the hall, were greeted and shown to their room. 
She very obviously followed the advice. 
Somehow or other he managed to shake some sort of smile at her. 
It was like being shut up in a box with grandma. 
They sat outside the house in long chairs under coloured parasols. 
The icy wind blew out her apron into a balloon. 
She turned away from the Buddha with one of her vague gestures. 
Why did the photographs of dead people always fade so. 
Her face, puffed up, red, with swollen eyes and swollen lips, looked terrible. 
Oh, what a joy it is to own things. 
Isabel stood up in her excitement and moved her elbows like wings. 
The bell jangled, the red serge curtains parted, and Mrs. Stubbs appeared. 
They were dressed alike in blue jerseys and knickers. 
big twists and curls jostled and shouldered each other as the silvery beams broadened. 
How could the poor darling help not having any money. 
You look like a little boy with your hair blowing about in the wind. 
For us, she said, there will be a double joy. 
Two dogs sprawled in the middle of the road, scuffling and biting. 
He also forsook work, and stood by the window, picking his nose. 
Would you come with me as far as the railway station and back. 
And the carpet we made ourselves out of old clothes. 
Bertha, turning to the youngest of the five, how changed. 
To my plebeian eyes that afflicted child was singularly unattractive. 
A tall young girl got out, leading a child by the hand. 
There was a picture of her only last week in 'Sport and Salon.' 
Now, there is something peculiarly intimate in sharing an umbrella. 
When the door was closed we raised a triumphant cry. 
He was always the first to enter the dining-room and the last to leave. 
Ah, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far. 
The corridors were silent and cold. 
from the hollow class-rooms came a quick drumming of voices. 
The straw basket of programmes was tossed from arm to arm. 
There were a number of people out this afternoon, far more than last Sunday. 
Peering through that round eye she could see far off some rocks. 
I think its up to Moira to use her little arts and wiles. 
We shall have to anoint ourselves with butter, said Dennis. 
It was thirty-five years old. 
but it was most unfortunate. 
Fancy, she has a separate plate for each of her front teeth. 
A young Russian, with a bang curl on her forehead, turned to me. 
Lights were turned on immediately the cafe opened, and business was very brisk. 
His red face was covered with pimples, and his nails indescribably filthy. 
it is beautiful enough to hang from a watch-chain. 
she asked, leaning her arms on the table and pillowing her breast against them. 
In Austria even the cabmen have serviettes. 
Not even an efficient waiter can you have by yourselves. 
I chewed a leaf and hugged my knees. 
The manager immediately left the room to find a new nib. 
I suppose you are frightened of an invasion, too, eh. 
He flung his hat on to the huge bed and went towards her. 
And he had taken hold of the end of her ostrich feather boa. 
I saw a beautiful umbrella broken in half like that on my way over. 
Our client moreover is positive... 
I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of cocoa in the tin. 
He felt awfully out of it. 
Calm yourself, she said superbly. 
She had arranged things in a special order and then called Josephine to witness. 
she raised her pale eyebrows until they rippled away into her pale hair. 
Olive, pet, said Laura, looking over her shoulder. 
It was the heavy piano being moved on its stiff castors. 
Must they be hidden by a marquee. 
it was muffled as though the dog had its head in a sack. 
and a quick, bold, evil feeling started up in her breast. 
She was a long, strange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet. 
The little girls ran into the paddock like chickens let out of a coop. 
He only woke up once last night. 
First man in as usual. 
And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist. 
And then in the rocky gateway the shepherd himself appeared. 
He paused by the window and glanced at her a moment over his shoulder. 
She saw with joy that his eyes were full of tears. 
She struggled, and was quite amazed to realise how angry she felt. 
What does the pussy cat do all day. 
Squatting on her heels, Viola opened the letter. 
But by that time she had to peg out the washing for the Frau. 
After all, dash it, they were young still. 
No time to indulge in pernicious little habits. 
Fastidiously, his lips curling, Andreas picked his way through the water. 
is it rather the curse of my genius... 
Her loud, slightly harsh voice filled the salon. 
my peaceful attitude of mind towards it is completely destroyed. 
I make no secret of my age. 
That young man I refuse to converse with. 
Surely you have had more adventures than any man in Germany. 
He and Frau Fischer were old friends. 
Frau Hartmann, I congratulate you. 
and the greetings were so long and loud that I felt a sympathetic glow. 
They sway and languish dreamily, And we, close pressed, are kissing there. 
She came to my bedroom and offered to massage my arm. 
Such reserve, such a tender way with the child. 
I order double portions, and eat them in peace. 
I found myself pitying the Baron. 
How long are you remaining here. 
But you never have large families in England now. 
The carriage gates were pushed back. 
No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and such lips. 
They are eagerly bought by the soldiers. 
Glad to be home again, dearie. 
His heart was wrung with such a spasm that he could have cried out. 
It was as much part of the lesson as opening the piano. 
May I have the pleasure. 
It was glaring bright and stifling. 
Oh, what a loathsome thing to have done. 
The servants were talking as if they were alone in the house. 
The train gave a gentle lurch, they were off. 
Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed. 
The result looked like a gigantic dustbin. 
She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too. 
What about a fresh pineapple cream. 
How wrong, how wicked, feeling as I do. 
The very idea of such a thing was preposterous. 
a jolt might have done it so easily. 
She heard his stick thumping. 
Four men in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the garden path. 
Why is it so exciting to be awake when everybody else is asleep. 
Heaven reward thy sweet patience, lady mine, he murmured. 
Quickly all the little heads were jerked up. 
And somewhere, far away, grandma was lighting a lamp. 
Alice gave a loud, silly little titter. 
said old Mrs. Fairfield, setting her cap straight. 
The old woman sighed again and drew a long thread from the ball. 
Yes, that was her real grudge against life. 
He could not be disloyal. 
And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour. 
And she gave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at the other women. 
They were the Trout boys, Pip and Rags. 
No time to say good-bye. 
There ahead was stretched the sandy road with shallow puddles. 
I sent him home to change his clothes... 
I just saw her go out to buy some. 
Was it possible that the strange man was still there.... 
Why on earth had she asked him to wait a moment. 
I wonder how long it takes to become unconscious.... 
Ignorance must not go uncontradicted. 
Eight kilometres it must be. 
Oh, what a beautiful, noble idea. 
As you please, said the landlord, obviously scorning us. 
Allow me to introduce you to each other. 
Yes, nodding graciously to the Advanced Lady. 
shouted Hans, hitting Anton over the head with his empty cup. 
You told her you had caught a cold and been very worried. 
There was a gentle knock at the door and his mother came in. 
Then you are an Englishwoman. 
Then, presumably, the winged shaft struck her collar brooch. 
Such a brilliant way of putting things. 
But you cannot equal their dress materials. 
But doubtless they have not the same symbolical value for the English. 
This is my little English friend of whom I have spoken. 
The Professor drew in his feet and sat up sharply, pulling down his waistcoat. 
The quantity of fruit I have eaten on this bench he sighed. 
That is almost a mouthful in itself. 
He tilted back in his chair, chuckling with laughter. 
You were an innocent one, you were. 
Now they had five babies and twice as much money. 
Which resolution comforted her absolutely. 
But I consider child-bearing the most ignominious of all professions, I said. 
I said he was a sea-captain on a long and perilous voyage. 
A chestnut tree pushed green boughs against the window. 
I am not accustomed to such company. 
Her high-born reply was what interested me. 
I pricked up my ears. 
we gorged on scandals of High Birth generously buttered. 
Followed a complete and deathlike silence. 
he is not at all particular about his food. 
This morning I took a half bath. 
I must be back in London in September. 
Who ever heard of having children upon vegetables. 
I have not eaten meat for three years. 
There you are I said. 
They were ever so kind to me. 
she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. 
And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, All men ought to have hobbies. 
They are hard to resist. 
That might have brought her nearer. 
Her airy little voice mocked him. 
He bent over her and she looked up with her familiar half-smile. 
On a visit to our eldest girl, who was married last year. 
Love me as little as you like. 
The willow trees, outside the high, narrow windows, waved in the wind. 
his teeth gleamed when he smiled. 
Down came Mary on the opening chord. 
And when Leila compared him with her other partners he looked shabby. 
It gave her quite a shock again to see how old he was. 
Meg passed him on to Leila. 
There was a joyful flutter among the girls. 
Strange voices answered, Of course, my dear. 
Two old women in white aprons ran up and down tossing fresh armfuls. 
The third and the ninth as usual. 
She would like to have kept those wisps as a keepsake, as a remembrance. 
It must have had a knock, somehow. 
One Golden Hour Set with Sixty Diamond Minutes. 
now a gull flipped by. 
Now they were scattered over with foam. 
He clasped grandma in his arms and pressed her to him. 
She pressed her eyes with her knuckles and rocked to and fro. 
I thought they were only for servants. 
And just look at this nougat, he cried ecstatically, just look at it. 
Look here, said William, how are we going to sit. 
May thy head, William, lack not ointment. 
He touched her cool hand, her cool cheek. 
she was sitting in the open taxi outside. 
We are inclined to reconsider... 
It would frighten Ethel out of her life. 
Then she tied her apron and sat down to take off her boots. 
Overcome, I suppose, he said aloud, helping himself to the marmalade. 
Ma Parker gave no answer. 
And then we were outside again. 
I sipped my tea, leaned back, and even asked if I might smoke. 
She put the big, frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass. 
When a faint violin sounded she winced and bit her lip again. 
Are they allowed to take dogs in there. 
How can you talk of cutting off now. 
Oh, if you only knew how horrid I feel. 
And I do believe I know why I make you laugh. 
Biddy lay down with her tongue poked out. 
it was the shadow from the tree outside. 
Oh, eggs in various forms. 
And this time, said Josephine firmly, we must come to a definite decision. 
We were sure you are, too. 
It would be somehow so satisfactory. 
It was such beautiful, firm cardboard. 
Their cold lips quivered at the greenish brims. 
the cab was dreadfully stuffy. 
And do you expect me to pay for this gimcrack excursion of yours. 
A spasm of pity squeezed her heart. 
We can decide to-morrow, she said. 
He was given up to his dream. 
His head was sunk in the pillow, his eyes were closed. 
I only want to leave this basket. 
Men hung over the palings. 
People of that class are so impressed by arum lilies. 
No, wait, take the arum lilies too. 
Mrs. Sheridan fidgeted with her cup. 
And somehow that seemed quite the best plan... 
But it all seemed blurred, unreal, like a picture in the newspaper. 
then the children were unbuttoned. 
Jose began to be seriously annoyed. 
But still one must go everywhere. 
She looked mournfully and enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in. 
But at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them. 
she felt they were in her fingers, on her lips, growing in her breast. 
How very nice workmen were. 
Let us live our life, all new, all ours, from the very beginning. 
My very own for ever. 
He leapt across the flower-bed and seized her in his arms. 
She had no idea that he was grey. 
No guiding principle, let us call it. 
He was always full of new ideas, schemes, plans. 
The Hum was so deep it seemed to boom from underneath the ground. 
It must be awful, she said slowly. 
The blinds were being pulled down. 
He charged over the table and seemed to eat the cards up. 
Both of them had forgotten what the never was about. 
It happens to all of us sooner or later. 
it was as though a little piece of forked lightning was imprisoned in it. 
she breathed in a small whisper to the boy, Hallo, my funny. 
We know all about that. 
He waved his arms foolishly at his mother. 
The boy had turned over. 
he could not tell a lie. 
Linda saw that river, very wide, covered with little rafts and boats. 
but, drawing off one stocking and then the other, she felt a little beauty. 
Of course there were stories, but such stories. 
he ignored his wife just as she ignored him. 
Mrs. Sheridan got up and came over to her, carrying the hat. 
To think I should talk to a man like that. 
She smiled, and a look of deep content shone in her eyes. 
As Stanley helped himself his blue eyes widened. 
Once upon a time she was walking along a little white road, with oh. 
Then something immense came into view. 
the same soaking bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy palings. 
there was nothing to mark which was beach and where was the sea. 
The garden party by Katherine Mansfield 
Why, even a prostitute has a greater sense of generosity. 
but, in view of a premeditated journey together, we became delightfully cordial. 
Hang your coat on the landing and shake yourself over the banisters. 
Drop it, and come to the Club House with me and get some coffee. 
No thanks, he said grimly. 
she snarled, and swooping over she fastened her teeth in his glove. 
There was no man to disturb them. 
On Sunday a man has the right to expect his family. 
She broke off a little pink petal and smiled at it. 
In that moment together in the passage a miracle had happened. 
That was the life for her. 
they had looked at each other, stunned with the conflict and sympathised... 
Well, that had been a fascinating interlude. 
From the road a sudden shout of triumph. 
My dear little lady, you must not take the quotation literally. 
Oh, because they live close to the earth, and therefore despise it. 
Rather, under the lying garb of false masculinity. 
She creates that she may destroy. 
What right have they even to question each other. 
We marched en masse along the station road. 
Da, that child has such energy. 
The Frau Professor is going to be one of us for the afternoon. 
Shall we join the others. 
She stirred, looking at him with almost fear in her eyes. 
such great big black trees on either side. 
their cry sounded in the dreams of little children... 
Whatever would it look like when she carried two babies so. 
There was a little piece of candle burning in the enamel bracket. 
My insides are all twisted up with having children too quickly. 
Then come in when I call you and help me cut up the salad. 
Standing on tiptoe in the yard, she almost felt she would be blown away. 
He stuffed his mouth with bread and then swilled it down with the coffee. 
In a corner of the room the Man was fastening his braces. 
He began to plan a little trip for them. 
Marriage certainly changed a woman far more than it did a man. 
She certainly was a little thing. 
asked Andreas, loathing the man. 
He took up a book, and wheeled his arm-chair over to the window. 
Wind crept round the house, moaning drearily. 
Did your wife get any sleep last night. 
Tell me on the way up. 
Her easy acceptance pleased him. 
the gutters were choked with the leavings of Saturday night. 
But the Master gave her no opening. 
She was full of terrified joy and importance in the goings on upstairs. 
Straightaway Andreas felt that he was being accused. 
He sprang out of bed and went over to the window. 
Had to put the confounded thing under his pillow. 
he repeated it quickly several times, with a snapping movement of the jaws. 
I spend the day here now she answered. 
The death agony was dreadful, she said brightly. 
it makes such a pleasant excursion for a fine Saturday afternoon. 
And so large that I can go down there and walk about. 
I think it must be the umbrellas which make us look ridiculous. 
Here was someone beside her laughing, too. 
He ordered more port, and brought no book this time. 
But the outer door suddenly opening, she sprang to her feet and laughed. 
She brushed out her long hair and gathered it in her hands... 
Well, you are a funny one, she said. 
You go downstairs, leave me alone. 
Sabina took on the extra work without any thought of extra pay. 
It meant an extra half-hour in bed for her. 
You are ready to come with me. 
And I do not see any possible light out of this darkness. 
And mamma says, 'Please pour out my mixture first.'
But what a bother, said I. 
Thus the modern soul and I found ourselves together under the stars. 
My spirit starves for want of that. 
He was off duty and intended to show it. 
We were thrilled and silent. 
and retired, the very young gentleman dodging her train and scowling. 
Yes, I know you have no love for me, And no forget-me-not. 
What do you intend to recite, Fraulein Sonia. 
I forget nothing, mamma, answered Sonia. 
Sonia, dear, is the dew falling. 
It has given me quite a touch of hay fever. 
But the tragedy of the story is this: 
The conversation is not out of your depth. 
I prefer watching you eat them. 
I have been making music for them on my trombone. 
The children were all soundly sleeping. 
God, the trouble you gave me. 
He was a traveller, and only stayed at their house two nights. 
They had to get the priest to her. 
Fancy Theresa bringing that child with her. 
Lights shone out from every window, wreaths of fir twigs hung from the ledges. 
You must tuck the ends into your boots until we get there. 
While he is away you have a fever in your blood. 
When I meet new people I squeeze them dry like a sponge. 
You look like a little Persian kitten. 
The Herr Rat had a bathing appointment, she said, shutting the door after her. 
Young blood, answered the Herr Rat genially. 
Nothing rested him so much then as for me to stroke his head. 
I am getting a few notes together. 
But I prefer them to look over your head. 
I smiled and shrugged my shoulders. 
Naturally, absent from home one must expect much discomfort and strange food. 
That is a very nice idea. 
There is a piece of that beautiful flannel petticoat you left us last summer. 
The washstand has, of course, been scrubbed over with soda. 
Each year I come expecting to find you with an empty nest. 
There was no maid, replied the manager, save for your gracious sister and daughter. 
Was love then a question of manicure. 
Look at my great fingers beside yours. 
For myself I do not understand how you women ever get married at all. 
Youth should be like a wild rose. 
She sighed and turned up her eyes. 
And, fancy now, she has already had six proposals of marriage. 
But we were living at too high pressure in those days. 
I begged the poet to repeat the verses once more. 
And to-day we are going to look for wild flowers in the wood. 
Spring like a doe upon the fields And find your beauty there.' 
I hope you are not tired after your journey. 
And a carriage drew up at the door. 
But the child is dumb ventured the manager apologetically. 
I have only received the letter acquainting me with the fact this morning. 
A wise idea, I answered. 
I fear, he said, that my luggage will be damp. 
But he himself volunteered some information. 
Together we walked through the mud and slush. 
Who could tell what the Future held. 
Suddenly the door opened and admitted the Baron. 
He wears one a month, with two soft collars. 
Never had I seen him at the Casino or the Bath Establishment. 
At the end of the meal we were served with coffee. 
There was a lady from the Spanish Court here in the summer. 
I really do not know, I answered. 
They were handed cherry cake with whipped cream. 
then I do my exercises for an hour, and my work is over. 
If we did we would have had her long ago. 
So that is the great secret of your English tea. 
I can make very good tea. 
Do they really eat so much. 
Nothing at all, cried Herr Hoffmann from Berlin. 
The Swing of the Pendulum. 
Urgently they rushed around 
Through the big, airy, darkened house there floated far-away voices, far-away sounds. 
Oil lamps shed a warm, bright light on the walls.
I have once described her in her autograph album as a tigress.
Now the question is, whether we shall keep her or not. 
Leila lived with her old Gran. 
Her mother followed her out of the marquee. 
The little dressing-table and mirror at the far end. 
A bell sounded far over the water.
As soon as you and I are old enough, we'll escape. 
Stanley lifted up to see a dark head bobbing far out and an arm lifted. 
I invariably carry it with me in this bag, for servants are untrustworthy. 
The pleasures of intellectual intercourse. 
There are hundreds of cabs about at that time. 
Sonia absorbed my outward and visible form.
He chose a tie out of the chest of drawers.
some dreadful man tried to kiss her at the club ball. 
It had been a rule for years never to disturb father in the morning.
We can't disturb Kate again, she said softly. 
I imbibe nourishment in my room. 
They took it for granted it was your job to slave away for them. 
I too know of much joy. 
But in the afternoon six or seven choice spirits played cards.
Not to have cared enough to scratch out that word disgust. 
Oh, mamma, please don't say such things. 
It is not so much throwing things out of windows 
They were far too grown-up to really care about such things. 
It doesn't matter, they're all busy upstairs. 
They're such awfully nice men. 
But you're heathenishly beautiful. 
An immense palace of pink-and-white marble with orange-trees outside the doors. 
A sheep with three legs or a cow that had lost one horn. 
You've simply played with Victor in my presence.
Up a little path of round white pebbles they went. 
We may as well. 
You may as well bring me a chocolate too. 
She drew his hand away as they came to the brighter streets. 
She found her way out of the door.
The one, old and scraggy, dressed almost entirely in black bead trimming
She saw her great big shadow on the wall.
Everybody was down on the beach, out of sight, out of hearing. 
Their first words always were as they ran to greet him, What have you got for me, daddy. 
Laughing, sneering, jeering, stretching out their hands while she read them William's letter. 
A whole pound of butter, and such a large johnny cake that it looked like an advertisement for somebody's baking-powder.
